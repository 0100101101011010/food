## Recipe notes

![nutrition information for milk tea made with powder](/food/recipe/images/homemade-bubble-tea-milk-tea-nutrition-1.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right} ![nutrition information for milk tea made with brewed tea](/food/recipe/images/homemade-bubble-tea-milk-tea-nutrition-2.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

*Nutrition information calculated without toppings.*

\* Btw, it's totally fine to use honey, syrup, sugar, or anything else to sweeten your drink. I use natural stevia, a 0 calorie sweetener, to make it healthier.

### Mix-n-Match Toppings

The great thing about making homemade boba is you can customize your drink to your heart's content. Tea shops usually charge 50¢ for every topping, like tapioca pearls or jellies, but you can buy your own toppings at the store for much less.

My personal favourite topping is unsweetened herbal grass jelly. On its own, it's quite flavourless, with a hint of herbal medicine, but it goes so well with a sweet, creamy tea.

The brand that I use (just the first one I spotted on the store aisles) is only 75 calories for the entire can, and I use just 1/5 of it for each glass of milk tea! It is firmer than the grass jelly they use in shops, and has a more satisfying chew to it.

## Which option do you prefer?

Having tried both to brew my own black tea as well as using a pre-made powder, I have to say the powder option is tastier. The tea flavour is a lot more concentrated, like store-bought bubble tea. However, brewing your own is much healthier, without all the additives that powder mixes throw in, and it's something you can drink every day.

Both are still healthier than store-bought options, though, and so much more affordable! I bought my 700 g bag of milk tea powder for $6.99, which comes down to 80¢ per glass. If you choose to brew your own tea and add milk powder, that's even more inexpensive. Bubble tea cafes charge upwards of $3.99 for their smallest cups, so you're saving over $3 every time you choose to make tea at home.

You can even brew a huge batch (I typically make 1–2 litres at a time now) and store them in plastic water bottles in the fridge, so you can quickly satisfy your boba craving whenever it hits you. :-)
