ingredients:
 - 7 g active dry yeast (or 6 g instant yeast)
 - 190 g water
 - 12 g white sugar
 - 20 g vegetable oil (or melted butter)
 - 300 g bread flour (most recipes say you can also use all-purpose flour, but I find all-purpose flour more sticky and hard to use)
 - 6 g fine salt

instructions:
 - MIX INGREDIENTS. Pour the water into a large mixing bowl and stir in the yeast and sugar.
 - Leave for ten minutes or until the yeast/water mixture forms a thick, foamy top layer (skip this step if you're using instant yeast).
 - Add the vegetable oil or butter, bread flour, and salt, in that order.
 - Mix with a fork until roughly incorporated, then give the dough a few squeezes with your hands. Wipe the sides of the bowl with the dough if there are any large clumps of dough still clinging to the walls.
 - At this point, the dough should be able to hold a rough ball shape but still be quite sticky and gooey. If it is sticking ALL OVER your fingers when you pull away, rather than mostly lifting off with ease, your dough is too sticky. Try kneading for a minute more and if that doesn't work, add more flour 1 tbsp at a time. Turn the dough out onto the (clean!!) counter and flip the bowl over top, so it's covering the dough. (I've always used bread flour for this recipe and have never had the dough stick to the counter, but you may want to sprinkle a little bit of flour in case if you are using all-purpose flour or if your dough seems extremely sticky.)

*(And the tastiest too!) These simple 4-ingredient ladoos are so creamy and delicious, I couldn't stop eating them even before they cooled down. Did I mention it's a one-pot recipe?!*

Wait for five minutes.

"KNEADING" METHOD. Remove the bowl and flatten the dough slightly by patting it down. Stretch the top portion and pull it down over the bottom, about 1/3 of the way down. Rotate the dough 90° and repeat with the new "top". Continue until you have folded the dough four times, and flip it over so the smooth side is facing up. It should be in a roughly rounded shape. Replace the bowl over the dough.

Wait for five minutes and repeat the folding procedure.

Wait another five minutes and repeat the folding procedure.

FIRST RISE. This is the first (of three) long waiting periods. Simply leave the dough under the mixing bowl after your third fold and let it rest for an hour.

SECOND RISE. Remove the bowl and pat it down aggressively to get rid of all the air bubbles. This can take a while—see the animation for an example—but it's very fun. Like popping bubble wrap!

## Recipe notes

I used my [Blendtec](https://amzn.to/2FrvF89) to grind up the cardamom pods. You could also use a mortar and pestle to grind them up. Note that it doesn't have to be super uniform and fine.

See the step-by-step pictures below for an idea of what your recipe should look like at each stage; it's important not to rush the process!

Because this recipe is made with chickpea flour, it also has the benefit of being gluten-free, for those with celiac disease. Also, ghee is lactose-free, so that's a good option for the lactose-intolerant peeps.

Cooling the ladoos is optional, but the inner texture is different when eaten warm (more chewy, like peanut butter) vs room temperature (crumbly and "flaky"). I like both! This is what the inside of a still-warm ladoo looks like. Very similar to peanut butter cookie dough!

## A mind-numbingly easy recipe

So me and my Indian coworker both love food, and during one conversation about what we wished we were eating that day, he brought up ladoos. The first (and only) time I've eaten ladoos was in my first year of uni when my roommate had brought them all the way from India. Even though that happened over a year ago, I haven't forgotten the unique taste and texture.

So when my coworker mentioned ladoos, I was instantly reminded of this experience. I googled the ingredients and was surprised to find out they are actually pretty simple, and I already had all the ingredients in my pantry! I told my coworker I was going to make ladoos one of these days and bring them in for him to try. He seemed skeptical at the time, tbh. It's probably been a month since I first made that promise, but hey a late delivery is better than never, and I'm sure he didn't mind. In fact, he loved these ladoos so much he saved an extra one to bring home for his sister.

A lot of ladoo recipes call for other ingredients to add in like cashews or other flours, but I wanted to keep mine simple so I could enjoy the pure taste of roasted chickpea. It's pretty rare to find chickpeas in a sweet dish, but it really shines in this recipe. Of course, you can add other things to if you want—like cookies, ladoos have endless variations. I'm sure most chopped nuts would work well, as would dried coconut. Maybe even chocolate chips?

After initially mixing chickpea flour into the butter, it will look very crumbly and dry.

![butter begins oozing out when mixture is ready](/food/recipe/images/easiest-ladoos-ever-2.jpg){:width="100%"}{: .image-left}

Eventually (and it may feel like forever), the chickpea flour will darken, butter will start leaking out, and the dough will look wet.

At this point, you can turn the heat off.

Add sugar and cardamom to the ladoos.

Mixing thoroughly...

If it's ready, the mixture should not stick to the saucepan or your hands when you start handling it.

Roll into small balls!
