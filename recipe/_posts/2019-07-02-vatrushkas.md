ingredients:
 - 60 g (scant 1/3 cup) sugar + 2 tbsp sugar, divided
 - 8 g (1 tbsp) active dry yeast (or 6 g instant yeast, or 21 g fresh yeast)
 - 250 mL (1 cup) milk, warm
 - 2 eggs
 - 500 g (4 cups) flour
 - 75 g (heaping 1/3 cup) butter, room temperature
 - 6 g (1 tsp) fine salt
 - 200 g farmer's cheese or cottage cheese
 - 2 tbsp sour cream
 - 1 tsp vanilla extract or lemon zest

instructions:
 - Mix 60 g of sugar, yeast, and milk.
 - Add 1 egg and whip with a mixer using the whisk attachment.
 - Add flour, butter, and salt, kneading until it forms a soft dough. (It will be soft but will not stick to your hands.)
 - Let dough rise in a covered bowl until it doubles in size, 1–2 hours.
 - Divide dough into 14 equal parts and form each into a ball.
 - Place balls onto a lined baking sheet and let them rest, covered, to rise again.
 - While dough is rising, prepare filling. Combine farmer's cheese, sour cream, vanilla extract or lemon zest, 2 tbsp sugar, and 1 egg until well mixed.
 - Once balls have doubled in size, dip the bottom of a glass or cup into flour and press it into the middle of each ball, creating an indentation. Fill each indentation with the cheese filling.
 - Brush each vatrushka with milk or egg wash (optional) before baking at 390 °F (200 °C) for 20 minutes, or until golden brown.

Wait for five minutes.

"KNEADING" METHOD. Remove the bowl and flatten the dough slightly by patting it down. Stretch the top portion and pull it down over the bottom, about 1/3 of the way down. Rotate the dough 90° and repeat with the new "top". Continue until you have folded the dough four times, and flip it over so the smooth side is facing up. It should be in a roughly rounded shape. Replace the bowl over the dough.

Wait for five minutes and repeat the folding procedure.

Wait another five minutes and repeat the folding procedure.

FIRST RISE. This is the first (of three) long waiting periods. Simply leave the dough under the mixing bowl after your third fold and let it rest for an hour.

SECOND RISE. Remove the bowl and pat it down aggressively to get rid of all the air bubbles. This can take a while—see the animation for an example—but it's very fun. Like popping bubble wrap!


## Nutrition and Cost Breakdown

## Recipe notes

You can add a variety of fillings to the cheese mixture. Fresh fruits like blueberries, apricots, peaches work well, so do dried ones like raisins or currants. Chopped nuts also work.

If you really want to be fancy, sprinkle some powdered sugar or shredded coconut on top after baking.

## A mind-numbingly easy recipe

So me and my Indian coworker both love food, and during one conversation about what we wished we were eating that day, he brought up ladoos. The first (and only) time I've eaten ladoos was in my first year of uni when my roommate had brought them all the way from India. Even though that happened over a year ago, I haven't forgotten the unique taste and texture.

So when my coworker mentioned ladoos, I was instantly reminded of this experience. I googled the ingredients and was surprised to find out they are actually pretty simple, and I already had all the ingredients in my pantry! I told my coworker I was going to make ladoos one of these days and bring them in for him to try. He seemed skeptical at the time, tbh. It's probably been a month since I first made that promise, but hey a late delivery is better than never, and I'm sure he didn't mind. In fact, he loved these ladoos so much he saved an extra one to bring home for his sister.

A lot of ladoo recipes call for other ingredients to add in like cashews or other flours, but I wanted to keep mine simple so I could enjoy the pure taste of roasted chickpea. It's pretty rare to find chickpeas in a sweet dish, but it really shines in this recipe. Of course, you can add other things to if you want—like cookies, ladoos have endless variations. I'm sure most chopped nuts would work well, as would dried coconut. Maybe even chocolate chips?
