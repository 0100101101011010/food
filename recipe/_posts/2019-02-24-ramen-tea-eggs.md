ingredients:
 - 1 head of cauliflower
 - 25 g butter (about 2 tbsp)
 - 10 g flour (about 2 tbsp)
 - 150 mL milk
 - 1 cup roughly chopped cheese (I used marbled cheddar)

instructions:
 - Steam cauliflower until almost fall-apart tender. I used my Instant Pot's STEAM function (5 min @ high).
 - While you let the cauliflower cool, add butter and flour to a medium saucepan on medium heat and whisk together.
 - When thoroughly mixed, add milk and turn heat down to low. Whisk frequently until sauce thickens.
 - Stir in two-thirds of the cheese and turn off heat.
 - When cauliflower is cool enough to handle, break into small florets and add to saucepan. Stir, coating all the florets.
 - Pour into a small glass casserole dish (or foil-lined baking pan) and sprinkle remaining cheese on top.
 - Bake at 375° F on the second-to-top rack for 25–30 minutes, or until golden on top.
