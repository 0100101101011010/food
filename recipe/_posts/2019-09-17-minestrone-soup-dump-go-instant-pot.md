ingredients:
  - splash of olive oil
  - 1 can (or 400 g cooked) great northern beans, drained
  - 2 carrots
  - 2 stalks of celery
  - 1 tsp fine salt
  - 1.5 tsp ground black pepper
  - 1 tsp paprika
  - 1 tbsp Italian seasoning*
  - 85 g (1/2 cup) small pasta
  - 1 tbsp (3 cloves) minced garlic
  - 1 tbsp chili garlic sauce, sambal oelek, or sriracha (if you don't have any of these, use 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes)
  - 2 heaping tbsp tomato paste
  - 1 L (4 cups) chicken stock or vegetable stock (I used 1 L water + 1 rounded tsp vegetable bouillon powder)
  - 2 cups spinach or 2 stalks of kale

instructions:
 - Mix 60 g of sugar, yeast, and milk.
 - Add 1 egg and whip with a mixer using the whisk attachment.
 - Add flour, butter, and salt, kneading until it forms a soft dough. (It will be soft but will not stick to your hands.)
 - Let dough rise in a covered bowl until it doubles in size, 1–2 hours.
 - Divide dough into 14 equal parts and form each into a ball.
 - Place balls onto a lined baking sheet and let them rest, covered, to rise again.
 - While dough is rising, prepare filling. Combine farmer's cheese, sour cream, vanilla extract or lemon zest, 2 tbsp sugar, and 1 egg until well mixed.
 - Once balls have doubled in size, dip the bottom of a glass or cup into flour and press it into the middle of each ball, creating an indentation. Fill each indentation with the cheese filling.
 - Brush each vatrushka with milk or egg wash (optional) before baking at 390 °F (200 °C) for 20 minutes, or until golden brown.
