## Recipe Notes

![minestrone soup with kale](/food/recipe/images/minestrone-soup-dump-go-instant-pot-3.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

Whether you are using canned beans or cooked your own from dry, you can save the drained liquid (called aquafaba) and use it as a substitute for eggs in so many recipes.

Adjust any of the ingredients to your liking! I love garlicky flavour so I added 2 whole tbsps of garlic. I also use 1.5 L of stock because I prefer a more soupy version of minestrone. The only thing I wouldn't touch would be the chili garlic sauce; if you add more than 1 tbsp, it becomes too spicy and not really true to minestrone anymore.

\* You can leave out the olive oil to make it healthier.

** I use my own homemade Italian seasoning, using [this recipe](https://addapinch.com/italian-seasoning-mix-recipe/).

## What Kinds of Pasta Should You Use?

![lumachine dry pasta](/food/recipe/images/minestrone-soup-dump-go-instant-pot-1.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-left}

Technically, any shape of pasta would work. If you're using a larger pasta, like farfalle or penne, increase the Pressure Cook time to 4 minutes. Personally, though, I prefer smaller-shaped pastas for soups.

In the video, I'm using a type of pasta called *lumachine*, which I picked up on my [recent trip to Italy](/blog/italy-trip-venice-bologna-milan). The pasta shells resemble little critters. So cute!
