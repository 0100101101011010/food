ingredients:
 - 1 cup flour
 - 1 tbsp sugar
 - 2 tsp baking powder
 - 1/4 tsp fine salt
 - 1 tsp ground cinnamon
 - 40 g aquafaba or 1 flax egg
 - a little over 1 cup of plant-based milk (I use soy)
 - 1 tsp vanilla extract, divided
 - 2 tbsp margarine or vegan butter
 - 20 g cashews, soaked for at least 1 hour (or 2 tbsp vegan cream cheese)
 - 1/4 cup powdered sugar
 - 2–3 tbsp plant-based milk (I use soy)
 - cooking spray (optional)

instructions:
 - Mix together the first five ingredients with a fork. Make a well in the middle.
 - Into the well, add the aquafaba, 1 cup of milk (reserve 2–3 tbsp for the icing), and 1/2 vanilla extract. Briefly whisk together, then combine everything in the bowl until well-incorporated. (Some lumps are ok.)
 - Spray mini waffle maker with cooking oil if desired. Pour batter into waffle maker and cook until for around 3 minutes, or until golden brown.
 - Drain the cashews. In a blender or food processor, combine the cashews and margarine until smooth.
 - Stir in powdered sugar, the remaining 1/2 of vanilla extract, and the remaining 2–3 tbsp of milk.
 - Drizzle icing over the waffles and serve warm.

![nutrition information for apple butter overnight oats](/food/recipe/images/thicc-apple-butter-overnight-oats-nutrition.jpg){:width="350 px"}{: .image-right}

This overnight oats recipe is so satisfyingly thick! It makes a pudding-like texture that fills you right up for hours and hours. But if you like your oats thinner, use half the amount of apple butter called for and add an extra 50 mL of soy milk. You can also take out the cottage cheese entirely, or swap it with greek yogurt, which will give the recipe a more tangy flavour.

### To make vegan or dairy free:

* Use vegan yogurt instead of cottage cheese.
* Replace the cottage cheese with a heaping spoonful of chia or flax seeds and an extra splash of vegan milk.
* The cottage cheese can be left out altogether.
