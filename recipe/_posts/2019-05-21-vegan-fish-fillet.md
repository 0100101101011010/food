ingredients:
 - 450 g okara (leftover pulp from soy milk), almond pulp, or other pulp
 - 20 g rice flour (if you have a high-speed blender, you can simply grind up 20 g of uncooked white rice to make your own flour)
 - 30 g soybean flour (again, you can grind your own from raw soybeans)
 - 70 g vital wheat gluten
 - 25 g tapioca flour
 - 1 scant tbsp (10 g) vegetable oil
 - 1.5 tsp fine salt
 - 5 sheets of nori

instructions:
 - Whisk rice flour, soybean flour, vital wheat gluten, tapioca flour, and salt together in a medium mixing bowl.
 - Add the vegetable oil and okara or nut pulp, and mix.
 - When the mixture is roughly incorporated, use your hands to "massage" the dough by squeezing it through your fists, until everything is well-mixed. (The mixture should be quite firm but malleable, a little dry and not too sticky.)
 - Shape a handful of the mixture into a log the length of the nori sheet. Adjust the size based on your preference (smaller log for sushi or snacking, larger for pan frying or curry).
 - Place log near one end of the nori sheet, and roll it up in the nori until you reach the other end.
 - Dip your fingers into a small bowl of water, or run them under the tap. Wet the edge of the nori and flatten it against the wrapped log, to "glue" in place. The "seam" should be indistinguishable from the rest of the log!
 - Slice logs into as many pieces as desired. (I cut each one into three.)
 - Arrange logs on a steaming rack or trivet so that none are touching each other. (However, they can be packed close together).
 - STOVETOP METHOD Heat enough water to cover an inch or two over the bottom of a saucepan or steamer on maximum heat until boiling, then adjust to medium, and steam for 40 minutes.
 - INSTANT POT METHOD Fill bottom of inner pot with 1 cup of water, then use STEAM function on high for 20 minutes. Allow pressure to naturally release.

## Recipe notes

I used my [Blendtec](https://amzn.to/2FrvF89) to grind up the cardamom pods. You could also use a mortar and pestle to grind them up. Note that it doesn't have to be super uniform and fine.

See the step-by-step pictures below for an idea of what your recipe should look like at each stage; it's important not to rush the process!

Because this recipe is made with chickpea flour, it also has the benefit of being gluten-free, for those with celiac disease. Also, ghee is lactose-free, so that's a good option for the lactose-intolerant peeps.

Cooling the ladoos is optional, but the inner texture is different when eaten warm (more chewy, like peanut butter) vs room temperature (crumbly and "flaky"). I like both! This is what the inside of a still-warm ladoo looks like. Very similar to peanut butter cookie dough!

## A mind-numbingly easy recipe

So me and my Indian coworker both love food, and during one conversation about what we wished we were eating that day, he brought up ladoos. The first (and only) time I've eaten ladoos was in my first year of uni when my roommate had brought them all the way from India. Even though that happened over a year ago, I haven't forgotten the unique taste and texture.

So when my coworker mentioned ladoos, I was instantly reminded of this experience. I googled the ingredients and was surprised to find out they are actually pretty simple, and I already had all the ingredients in my pantry! I told my coworker I was going to make ladoos one of these days and bring them in for him to try. He seemed skeptical at the time, tbh. It's probably been a month since I first made that promise, but hey a late delivery is better than never, and I'm sure he didn't mind. In fact, he loved these ladoos so much he saved an extra one to bring home for his sister.

A lot of ladoo recipes call for other ingredients to add in like cashews or other flours, but I wanted to keep mine simple so I could enjoy the pure taste of roasted chickpea. It's pretty rare to find chickpeas in a sweet dish, but it really shines in this recipe. Of course, you can add other things to if you wantâ€”like cookies, ladoos have endless variations. I'm sure most chopped nuts would work well, as would dried coconut. Maybe even chocolate chips?

After initially mixing chickpea flour into the butter, it will look very crumbly and dry.

![butter begins oozing out when mixture is ready](/food/recipe/images/easiest-ladoos-ever-2.jpg){:width="100%"}{: .image-left}

Eventually (and it may feel like forever), the chickpea flour will darken, butter will start leaking out, and the dough will look wet.

At this point, you can turn the heat off.

Add sugar and cardamom to the ladoos.

Mixing thoroughly...

![ladoo mixture should not stick](/food/recipe/images/easiest-ladoos-ever-6.jpg){:width="100%"}{: .image-left}

If it's ready, the mixture should not stick to the saucepan or your hands when you start handling it.

Roll into small balls!
