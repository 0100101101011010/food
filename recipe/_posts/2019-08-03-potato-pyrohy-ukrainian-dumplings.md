ingredients:
 - 60 g (scant 1/3 cup) sugar + 2 tbsp sugar, divided
 - 8 g (1 tbsp) active dry yeast (or 6 g instant yeast, or 21 g fresh yeast)
 - 250 mL (1 cup) milk, warm
 - 2 eggs
 - 500 g (4 cups) flour
 - 75 g (heaping 1/3 cup) butter, room temperature
 - 6 g (1 tsp) fine salt
 - 200 g farmer's cheese or cottage cheese
 - 2 tbsp sour cream
 - 1 tsp vanilla extract or lemon zest

instructions:
 - Mix 60 g of sugar, yeast, and milk.
 - Add 1 egg and whip with a mixer using the whisk attachment.
 - Add flour, butter, and salt, kneading until it forms a soft dough. (It will be soft but will not stick to your hands.)
 - Let dough rise in a covered bowl until it doubles in size, 1–2 hours.
 - Divide dough into 14 equal parts and form each into a ball.
 - Place balls onto a lined baking sheet and let them rest, covered, to rise again.
 - While dough is rising, prepare filling. Combine farmer's cheese, sour cream, vanilla extract or lemon zest, 2 tbsp sugar, and 1 egg until well mixed.
 - Once balls have doubled in size, dip the bottom of a glass or cup into flour and press it into the middle of each ball, creating an indentation. Fill each indentation with the cheese filling.
 - Brush each vatrushka with milk or egg wash (optional) before baking at 390 °F (200 °C) for 20 minutes, or until golden brown.
