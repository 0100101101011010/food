[French Canadian cuisine] is for the sturdy male with an appetite whetted by a day’s touring along the Gaspe Coast or in the clean fresh air of the Laurentides ; for the amateur gourmet who can’t resist the lure of a new dish or the hunter coming into camp after a day’s tramping through the woods.

Take the case of what might be called Canada’s National Dish. Soupe aux pois a la Canadienne,
pea soup to you. Of course you’ve had it at home. But did you try it in Quebec ? To French Canadians there is nothing very special about it. They have it at home at least once a week. Here is one mess of potage for which you don’t have to give up any of your inheritance; though we believe it’s well worth while. We know some people who’d be ready to plow through three feet of snow to get to it, hot and smoking, full bodied and palate satisfying.

Of course you’re a bit sceptic. You order it because you’ve heard it’s the thing to have in Quebec. The maid brings it, and from then on you are no more a gourmet but a gourmand . After a while, you ask yourself what makes it different from the one you’ve had elsewhere. Before you’re quite sure, you find out, to your surprise and chagrin, that you’ve already emptied your plate. Deeply engrossed you pay no heed to reason’s pleading and you order another plateful. This time you are careful. Slowly you savour it. Spoonful by spoonful, tasting each one carefully. Better than the last time you notice the delightful flavour, the faint taste of herbs, the slight aroma of lard sale and an elusive something that you can’t analyse. To catch it, and purely in the interest of science and a better knowledge of cuisine, you might throw caution to the winds and try again. If you do, watch out ! The cuisiniere might feel flattered but don’t think of your figure too much.
