ingredients:
 - 15 shiitake mushrooms (dried or fresh)
 - 1 block of tofu (400–500 g), firm or extra firm works best
 - 300 g bok choy or baby bok choy
 - 2 tbsp rice vinegar (apple cider vinegar works as well)
 - 2 tbsp soy sauce
 - 1 tbsp oyster sauce (if vegan, use mushroom-made oyster sauce) or hoisin sauce
 - 1 tbsp minced garlic
 - 2 packages of dumpling wrappers

instructions:
 - Add 1 cup of water to the bottom of the Instant Pot.
 - Wash and pat dry the mushrooms and bok choy; chop finely. (If using dried shiitake mushrooms, soak them in 1 cup of water for at least 10 minutes to rehydrate.)
 - Crumble tofu into a large mixing bowl, and add the mushrooms and bok choy. Stir in the rest of the ingredients except for dumpling wrappers.
 - After everything is well-incorporated, add ~1 tbsp of the filling mixture to a dumpling wrapper (or however much you can without it overflowing).
 - Dip your fingers in some water, then fold the dumpling wrapper in half and press firmly along the seams all the way around to seal the dumpling.
 - Place on a steamer basket and set in a trivet inside the Instant Pot. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling. You will have to steam in batches, I could only fit six or seven dumplings in the steamer at a time.
 - Use the Instant Pot's STEAM function on High for 2 minutes (if yours doesn't have the STEAM function, the manual PRESSURE COOK function works fine). When done, immediately quick release.
 - You can either eat your dumplings right away, fry them up in a skillet for potstickers, or freeze them for meal prep.

## Recipe notes

![veggie dumplings in bamboo steamer basket](/food/recipe/images/instant-pot-veggie-dumplings-1.jpg)

When arranging the dumplings in the Instant Pot, they can be packed quite close together, but make sure none of them are touching.

You do *not* have to use a bamboo steamer like the photo above, any metal steamer is fine too. If you don't have a steamer basket, lay a large piece of parchment paper over the trivet that came with your instant pot, and rest your dumplings on top.

Btw, it doesn't really matter what kind of wrapper you use, ones for wontons / potstickers / gyoza all work fine. Personally I just use [this brand](https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/sun-on-dumpling-wrappers/6000196789446), it's the easiest to find around here.

## Got Leftover Filling?

Easy answer: throw it into your next stir-fry or fried rice dish!

![tofu bok choy mushroom burrito](/food/foodventures/images/tofu-bok-choy-mushroom-burrito.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right}

This other method is a little unorthodox, but I rolled up my extra dumpling filling in a tortilla to make some kind of ["Asian-Mexican fusion" burrito](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-aug-5-11/#tofu-bok-choy-mushroom-burrito), and frankly it was delicious with some spicy mayo.

Maybe it's /r/shittyfoodporn material, but hey, the protein from the tofu makes it sturdy and filling and the mushrooms and sauce make it so savoury. 10/10 would make filling again just for burrito stuffing.

## Dipping Sauces

For dipping sauces, I like [this one](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/162361/gyoza-sauce/), a classic in our Asian household growing up! A spicy Japanese also goes really well.

## How to Freeze and Reheat Dumplings

Lay dumplings (it's fine if they're still hot) in a single-layer on a wax paper or parchment paper lined sheet and freeze. When they're solid, you can transfer them to a ziploc bag or container for easy storage.

To reheat, add just enough water to a non-stick skillet to cover the bottom. Add about a tsp of oil to the water, then turn on the stove to maximum heat. Add dumplings to the skillet (again, they can be close together but make sure they don't touch) and let boil, uncovered. Don't worry if there is some popping and splashing due to the oil and water reacting. When the water has almost completely boiled off, turn the heat down to medium. When all the water is gone, flip the dumplings and fry the other side until both sides are a nice golden brown.
