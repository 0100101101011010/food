ingredients:
 - 15 shiitake mushrooms (dried or fresh)
 - 1 block of tofu (400â€“500 g), firm or extra firm works best
 - 300 g bok choy or baby bok choy
 - 2 tbsp rice vinegar
 - 2 tbsp soy sauce
 - 1 tbsp oyster sauce (if vegan, use mushroom-made oyster sauce) or hoisin sauce
 - 1 tbsp minced garlic
 - 2 packages of dumpling wrappers

instructions:
 - Add 1 cup of water to the bottom of the Instant Pot.
 - (If using dried shiitake mushrooms, soak them in 1 cup of water for at least 10 minutes to rehydrate.)
 - Finely chop up the mushrooms and bok choy.
 - Crumble tofu into a large mixing bowl, and add the mushrooms and bok choy. Stir in the rest of the ingredients except for dumpling wrappers.
 - After everything is well-incorporated, add ~1 tbsp of the filling mixture to a dumpling wrapper (or however much you can without it overflowing).
 - Dip your fingers in some water, then fold the dumpling wrapper in half and press firmly along the seams all the way around to seal the dumpling.
 - Place on a steamer basket and set in a trivet inside the Instant Pot. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling.
 - Use the Instant Pot's STEAM function on High for 2 minutes (if yours doesn't have the STEAM function, the manual PRESSURE COOK function works fine). Quick release.
 - You can either eat your dumplings right away, fry them up in a skillet for potstickers, or freeze them for meal prep.

When arranging the dumplings together in the steamer basket, they can be packed quite close together, but make sure none of them are touching.

For dipping sauces, I like this one.

## How to Freeze and Reheat Dumplings

Lay dumplings (it's fine if they're still hot) in a single-layer on a wax paper or parchment paper lined sheet and freeze. When they're solid, you can transfer them to a ziploc bag or container for easy storage.

To reheat, add just enough water to a non-stick skillet to cover the bottom. Add about a tsp of oil to the water, then turn on the stove to maximum heat. Add dumplings to the skillet (again, they can be close together but make sure they don't touch) and let boil, uncovered. Don't worry if there is some popping and splashing due to the oil and water reacting. When the water has almost completely boiled off, turn the heat down to medium. When all the water is gone, flip the dumplings and fry the other side until both sides are a nice golden brown.
