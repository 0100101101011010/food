![nutrition information for apple butter overnight oats](/food/recipe/images/thicc-apple-butter-overnight-oats-nutrition.jpg){:width="350 px"}{: .image-right}

This overnight oats recipe is so satisfyingly thick! It makes a pudding-like texture that fills you right up for hours and hours. But if you like your oats thinner, use half the amount of apple butter called for and add an extra 50 mL of soy milk. You can also take out the cottage cheese entirely, or swap it with greek yogurt, which will give the recipe a more tangy flavour.

### To make vegan or dairy free:

* Use vegan yogurt instead of cottage cheese.
* Replace the cottage cheese with a heaping spoonful of chia or flax seeds and an extra splash of vegan milk.
* The cottage cheese can be left out altogether.
