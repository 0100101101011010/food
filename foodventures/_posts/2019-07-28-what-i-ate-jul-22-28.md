## Tuesday

![t&t snack haul](/food/foodventures/images/tnt-snack-haul.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

It's another lovely snack haul from T&T, this time featuring *four* different kinds of chips (one of them is made from peas!), some dried tofu kebabs, packets of savoury bean curd rolls, and a pineapple cake pastry! Everything here was delicious. Out of the chips, my favourites were both bags of Calbee brand chips (although the pea crackers were very unique and tasty, and the Cadina Hot & Spicy were so addictive too).

## Wednesday

### Traditional Shrewsbury Cookies

![shrewsbury cookies](/food/foodventures/images/shrewsbury-cookies-1.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}

This is a recipe over a hundred years old! I got it from *Mrs Beeton's All About Cookery,* a famous cookbook by Isabella Beeton.

I followed her recipe as closely as I could, except for reducing the sugar content just a little.

Ingredients:

- 113 g butter or margarine
- 113 g granulated sugar
- 1 egg
- 230 g all purpose flour
- 1/2 rounded tsp cinnamon powder (or 1 heaping tsp lemon zest)
- 50 g milk

![shrewsbury cookies](/food/foodventures/images/shrewsbury-cookies-2.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

Instructions:

1. Cream the butter or margarine with sugar and beat in the egg.
1. Sift flour with cinnamon, or add grated rind, and add to the creamed fat mixture. Mix to a stiff consistency, using milk if required.
1. Roll out fairly thinly and cut out with a 2½-in. cutter.
1. Place on a greased baking- sheet and bake at 350° F till light fawn colour.

I used the rims of a measuring cup and empty vanilla extract bottle to cut my doughnut-shaped cookies. Others, I forwent the smaller hole in the middle and just shaped them into circles. Still others, I shaped into adorable thumbprint cookies, filled with a spot of huckleberry jam.

The dough was so soft, buttery, and fun to work with. Unfortunately, due to the high butter content, my hands, rolling pin, and countertop were completely covered in grease by the end.

This is a great cookie to go with some jam. On their own, however, they were a bit lacking in flavour despite all the butter. They were also so brittle! Maybe I baked them for too long.

### Shitty Food Porn: Cheese Curds Edition

Yes, that is me eating cheese curds straight out of the bag. I don't have much of a caption for this one, but is an explanation really necessary? Me + cheese = love affair of the century.

### Veggie Egg Hash with Rice

![veggie egg hash with rice](/food/foodventures/images/veggie-egg-hash.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}

This humble lil sheet pan dinner was inspired by [/r/PutAnEggOnIt](https://www.reddit.com/r/PutAnEggOnIt/comments/cgtfzx/this_combo_was_incredible/), although I only kept the egg and zucchini and took liberties with everything else.

Roast chopped zucc, kernels of one fresh corn, and chunks of sauteed chorizo sausage with some salt and pepper at 325 °F (I did around 20 min). Then I added an egg, switched to the Broil setting on my oven at 400 °F and baked it for another five minutes.

Kevin surprised me by enjoying it! He didn't really care for the zucchini and said the egg was a bit overdone—it wasn't runny, even though I thought from the looks of it that it was *underbaked* rather than overbaked—so next time I think I'll swap the zucchini for bok choy or something and broil the egg for three minutes.

### Soft Matcha Cookies

![soft matcha cookies](/food/foodventures/images/soft-matcha-cookies.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-left}

Oof, these are not pretty to look at, aren't they? They look like the Incredible Hulk's poop or something.

It's probably a matter of using the wrong kind of matcha, but I've never been able to get a bright green colour out of anything I've baked with matcha. For this batch of cookies, I used a recipe for [matcha cookies with white chocolate chunks](https://salu-salo.com/white-chocolate-green-tea-cookies/), leaving out the chocolate.

I also ran out of egg and didn't realize it until I'd already committed to the recipe, but one of the commenters on the post said they'd had success using 6 oz of applesauce instead. Now, this seemed like a lot of applesauce for replacing just one egg and an extra yolk, so I should've trusted my judgement and used a lot less, but instead I added about 113 g, or 4 oz.

It's my fault that the cookies didn't turn out amazing. Don't get me wrong—I ate *all* of them, that's how much I love matcha flavours—but the taste and texture left a lot to be desired. It was *too* soft and had no chew whatsoever, and tasted a little flat.

### Twice-Baked Potatoes with Chorizo

![twice-baked potatoes with chorizo](/food/foodventures/images/twice-baked-potatoes-chorizo.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-left}

This is a very generous interpretation of [Fine Cooking's recipe](https://www.finecooking.com/recipe/twice-baked-potatoes-with-chorizo-and-roasted-red-pepper). Instead of sweet smoked paprika, I used regular paprika. Instead of Manchego, I used marble cheddar. I completely left out the roasted red pepper, sour cream, and parsley, because I didn't have those on hand. You gotta make do with what you have!

Despite the modifications, Kevin had no complaints. I tried one as well and agree it was delicious! It's such an easy recipe, too, so I'll definitely be making this again.

## Thursday

### Two Rounds for Taco Thursday

![chorizo breakfast tacos](/food/foodventures/images/chorizo-breakfast-tacos.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-left}

I bought some corn tortillas this week, planning to make Crunchwrap Supremes, but then I thought, in the meantime, why not use them for their ultimate purpose, tacos?! For lunch, I served up a simple recipe of chorizo "breakfast" tacos with potato hash and eggs on top, [recipe courtesy of Bon Appetit](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/breakfast-tacos-with-potato-hash-and-fried-eggs).

Instead of frying the egg on a skillet, I cracked it directly onto the tacos before putting them in the oven. I didn't squeeze the water out of the grated potatoes as directed, either, but this recipe was still a total success. The only thing Kevin said was missing was the chives, which would quickly be remedied this evening.

Also! He said he could've done without the eggs, which was totally surprisng to me. His final critique was that the tacos could be just a bit less cooked, as they were getting a little crispy and it was hard to fold them into a taco shape.

![chorizo chives tacos](/food/foodventures/images/chorizo-chives-tacos.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

Round 2 of tacos this evening was made following the same recipe as above, sans egg, avec chives, with a bit less grilling time.

Again, Kevin enjoyed the meal, but the hot taco in contact with the plate created a lot of condensation, which caused the bottom of the taco to get soft and soggy. This led to some of the tacos breaking apart in the centre. Tasty, just messier than we'd like.

Also, we added some hot sauce (Tabasco and Grace brands) to give it a little extra kick. It's fantastic!

![sprouted onion chives](/food/foodventures/images/sprouted-onion-chives.jpg){:width="20%"}{: .image-right}

Lifehack: if you don't wanna go out and buy chives, just leave your onions sitting on the counter instead of in the fridge for a couple of weeks. :-D
