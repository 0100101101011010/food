## Tuesday

![t&t snack haul](/food/foodventures/images/tnt-snack-haul.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

It's another lovely snack haul from T&T, this time featuring *four* different kinds of chips (one of them is made from peas!), some dried tofu kebabs, packets of savoury bean curd rolls, and a pineapple cake pastry. Everything here was delicious. Out of the chips, my favourites were both bags of Calbee brand chips (although the pea crackers were very unique and tasty, and the Cadina Hot & Spicy were so addictive too).

## Wednesday

### Traditional Shrewsbury Cookies

![shrewsbury cookies](/food/foodventures/images/shrewsbury-cookies-1.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}

This recipe is over a hundred years old! I got it from *Mrs Beeton's All About Cookery,* a famous cookbook by Isabella Beeton (since it's now in the public domain, you can read it for free; there's a link at the [Free Cookbooks](/food/cookbooks) collection).

I followed her recipe as closely as I could, except for reducing the sugar content just a little.

Ingredients:

- 113 g butter or margarine
- 113 g granulated sugar
- 1 egg
- 230 g all purpose flour
- 1/2 rounded tsp cinnamon powder (or 1 heaping tsp lemon zest)
- 50 g milk

![shrewsbury cookies](/food/foodventures/images/shrewsbury-cookies-2.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

Instructions:

1. Cream the butter or margarine with sugar and beat in the egg.
1. Sift flour with cinnamon, or add grated rind, and add to the creamed fat mixture. Mix to a stiff consistency, using milk if required.
1. Roll out fairly thinly and cut out with a 2½-inch cutter.
1. Place on a greased baking sheet and bake at 350 °F till light fawn colour.

I used the rims of a measuring cup and empty vanilla extract bottle to cut my doughnut-shaped cookies. Others, I forwent the smaller hole in the middle and just shaped them into circles. Still others, I shaped into adorable thumbprint cookies, filled with a spot of huckleberry jam.

![shrewsbury thumprint cookies](/food/foodventures/images/shrewsbury-cookies-3.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

This is a great cookie to go with some jam. It would also be a great canvas for a decorative icing design. On their own, however, the cookies were a bit lacking in flavour despite all the butter, and way too brittle. I think I overbaked them. I tried to follow Mrs Beeton's instructions to bake until they were "fawn"-coloured, but they turned out more like a "dark fawn."

### Shitty Food Porn: Cheese Curds Edition

![orange cheddar cheese curds](/food/foodventures/images/orange-cheese-curds-1.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-left} ![orange cheddar cheese curds](/food/foodventures/images/orange-cheese-curds-2.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-left}

Yes, that is me eating cheese curds straight out of the bag. I don't have much of a caption for this one, but is an explanation really necessary? Me + cheese = love affair of the century.

### Veggie Egg Hash with Rice

![veggie egg hash with rice](/food/foodventures/images/veggie-egg-hash.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}

This humble lil sheet pan dinner was inspired by [/r/PutAnEggOnIt](https://www.reddit.com/r/PutAnEggOnIt/comments/cgtfzx/this_combo_was_incredible/), although I only kept the egg and zucchini and took liberties with everything else.

Roast chopped zucc, kernels of one fresh corn, and chunks of sauteed chorizo sausage with some salt and pepper at 325 °F (I did around 20 min). Then I added an egg, switched to the Broil setting on my oven at 400 °F and baked it for another five minutes.

Kevin surprised me by enjoying it! He didn't really care for the zucchini and said the egg was a bit overdone—it wasn't runny, even though I thought from the looks of it that it was *underbaked* rather than overbaked—so next time I think I'll swap the zucchini for bok choy or something and broil the egg for three minutes.

### Soft Matcha Cookies

![soft matcha cookies](/food/foodventures/images/soft-matcha-cookies.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-left}

Oof, these are not pretty to look at, aren't they? They look like the Incredible Hulk's poop or something.

It's probably a matter of using the wrong kind of matcha, but I've never been able to get a bright green colour out of anything I've baked with matcha. For this batch of cookies, I used a recipe for [matcha cookies with white chocolate chunks](https://salu-salo.com/white-chocolate-green-tea-cookies/), leaving out the chocolate.

I also ran out of egg and didn't realize it until I'd already committed to the recipe, but one of the commenters on the post said they'd had success using 6 oz of applesauce instead. Now, this seemed like a lot of applesauce for replacing just one egg and an extra yolk, so I should've trusted my judgement and used a lot less, but instead I added about 113 g, or 4 oz.

It's my fault that the cookies didn't turn out amazing. Don't get me wrong—I ate *all* of them, that's how much I love matcha flavours—but the taste and texture left a lot to be desired. It was *too* soft and had no chew whatsoever, and tasted a little flat.

### Twice-Baked Potatoes with Chorizo

![twice-baked potatoes with chorizo](/food/foodventures/images/twice-baked-potatoes-chorizo.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-left}

This is a very generous interpretation of [Fine Cooking's recipe](https://www.finecooking.com/recipe/twice-baked-potatoes-with-chorizo-and-roasted-red-pepper). Instead of sweet smoked paprika, I used regular paprika. Instead of Manchego, I used marble cheddar. I completely left out the roasted red pepper, sour cream, and parsley, because I didn't have those on hand. You gotta make do with what you have!

Despite the modifications, Kevin had no complaints. I tried one as well and agree it was delicious! It's such an easy recipe, too, so I'll definitely be making this again.

## Thursday

### Two Rounds for Taco Thursday

![chorizo breakfast tacos](/food/foodventures/images/chorizo-breakfast-tacos.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-left}

I bought some corn tortillas this week, planning to make Crunchwrap Supremes, but then I thought, in the meantime, why not use them for their ultimate purpose, tacos?! For lunch, I served up a simple recipe of chorizo "breakfast" tacos with potato hash and eggs on top, [recipe courtesy of Bon Appetit](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/breakfast-tacos-with-potato-hash-and-fried-eggs).

Instead of frying the egg on a skillet, I cracked it directly onto the tacos before putting them in the oven. I didn't squeeze the water out of the grated potatoes as directed, either, but this recipe was still a total success. The only thing Kevin said was missing was the chives, which would quickly be remedied this evening.

Also! He said he could've done without the eggs, which was totally surprisng to me. His final critique was that the tacos could be just a bit less cooked, as they were getting a little crispy and it was hard to fold them into a taco shape.

![chorizo chives tacos](/food/foodventures/images/chorizo-chives-tacos.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

Round 2 of tacos this evening was made following the same recipe as above, sans egg, avec chives, with a bit less grilling time.

Again, Kevin enjoyed the meal, but the hot taco in contact with the plate created a lot of condensation, which caused the bottom of the taco to get soft and soggy. This led to some of the tacos breaking apart in the centre. Tasty, just messier than we'd like.

Also, we drizzled some hot sauce (Tabasco and Grace brands) to give it a little extra kick. It's fantastic! Kevin also added that something creamy, like sour cream or a spicy mayo, would've elevated this even more.

![sprouted onion chives](/food/foodventures/images/sprouted-onion-chives.jpg){:width="20%"}{: .image-left}

Lifehack: if you don't wanna go out and buy chives, just leave your onions sitting on the counter instead of in the fridge for a couple of weeks. BAM the freshest chives you'll ever find! :-D

## Friday

### Reheated Frozen Salami Cheese Sandwich

![salami cheese sandwich](/food/foodventures/images/salami-cheese-sandwich.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-left}

I prepped this back in [June](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jun-10-16/#hot-dog--sandwiches-meal-prep) for a quick meal solution. I finally got the opportunity to eat one today, as I woke up feeling hungry and very lazy.

I reheated it in the microwave, wrapped tight in a damp paper towel, which did a great job of sealing in the moisture. The bread wasn't too tough or dry, however, the overall sandwich left a lot to be desired. It definitely filled me up, but the reheated salami had a slightly unpleasant smell to it and the bread had a bit of that old freezer odour.

A year ago I was totally into the idea of meal prep, freezer meals, and once-a-month-cooking. Now I've totally rejected those concepts. Frozen cooked food does not match up to fresh at all. I'm still all for frozen raw ingredients, but something cooked should be eaten immediately or within the next week. Food kept in the freezer just sucks so much.

### Italian Sausage and Bok Choy Tacos

![italian sausage and bok choy tacos](/food/foodventures/images/italian-sausage-bok-choy-tacos.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}

Well these tacos are a bit unorthodox. I sauteed up some fresh Italian sausage and chopped baby bok choy, and threw on some minced garlic, then topped it with avocados after I took them out of the oven (to add some of that [creaminess Kevin wanted](#two-rounds-for-taco-thursday)).

Kevin: "The Bok Choy surprisingly works." The avocado didn't, though, much to my surprise because my boy luvs avo. Looks like we'll have to buy some spicy mayo for next time.

### Greek Yogurt Scones

Once again, I was craving something carb-forward tonight, so I decided to try out [these Greek yogurt scones](https://www.thespruceeats.com/fluffy-yoghurt-scones-recipe-1806173).

![greek yogurt scones](/food/foodventures/images/greek-yogurt-scones.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

I followed the recipe quite precisely, but I don't think the baking time given in the recipe was nearly enough. The top was lovely and fragrant, but there were spots within the middle that were still gummy. Nevertheless, with all that butter, they were bound to taste rich and delicious.

The one odd thing that's still a mystery to me is, it tastes distinctly cheesy, even though there's no cheese in it at all. I didn't think Greek yogurt would have such a strong cheesy flavour once baked! Kevin even went so far as to say that this dough would make a great pizza crust, lol! In fact, it was supposed to be sweet, what with the raisins in there. I ate it with some more huckleberry jam. It was definitely edible, but the cheese taste was so weird and unexpected.

## Saturday

### Shitty Italian Sausage

![shitty italian sausage](/food/foodventures/images/shitty-italian-sausage.jpg){:width="20%"}{: .image-left}

Well, there's not much to say here either. This was the single remaining sausage in the fridge, and it was taking up quite a lot of room in its bulky container, so I decided to get rid of it. I threw it in the oven's middle rack and checked on it every few minutes until it looked decently browned. The taste is quite good, even if it does look like an actual turd.

### Baked Fresh Teriyaki Tofu

![baked fresh teriyaki tofu](/food/foodventures/images/baked-fresh-tofu.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

Remembering how delicious a simple [teriyaki glazed tofu](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jul-1-7/#baked-teriyaki-tofu) can be, I decided to try it again, this time using "fresh tofu." Despite my love of tofu, I'm actually not too sure on what differentiates the different kinds of tofu are—I think this is because I adore tofu so much I'm willing to eat any and every variety without discrimination—but I'm only aware of "silky," "soft," "firm" and "extra firm." I'm guessing fresh tofu is somewhere between a soft and firm, which is supported by the results of this baking experiment.

As you can see, these tofu could quite puffy in the oven, and when I bit into them, there was still a good amount of water. Again, even though I baked these for longer than my last batch, they could do with even more browning and crispiness on the edges. Not quite as tasty as the [batch made with firm tofu](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jul-1-7/#baked-teriyaki-tofu), but definitely not bad and I could eat this again any day.

### Samyang Spicy Dumplings, Fried

![pan-fried samyang spicy dumplings](/food/foodventures/images/samyang-dumplings-3.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

I wasn't a huge fan of these dumplings [the last time](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jun-17-23/#samyang-hot-chicken-flavour-gyozadumplings) I tried them, but this time I tried pan-frying them after boiling. The crispy skin definitely proved to be an enhancement, but the overall flavour still isn't there for me. At least this time I finished the pack, which leaves more room in the freezer for future dumpling tests.

### Japanese Tofu Bread with Huckleberry Jam

![tofu bread loaf](/food/foodventures/images/tofu-bread-loaf-1.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right} ![tofu bread loaf](/food/foodventures/images/tofu-bread-loaf-2.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

I had high hopes for this [tofu bread from A Tomato in Tribeca](https://tomatointribeca.wordpress.com/2012/08/31/japanese-tofu-bread/), because tbh I'm excited by the idea of adding tofu into everything . The [last time I'd made a tofu bun](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-mar-25-31/), it had been better than my expectations. However, this batch didn't turn out quite as well. I actually made this bread twice today—once in the morning and once in the evening—following the same recipe. The flavour is definitely good, but there was a distinct taste of alcohol. The inside was *SOOO GUMMY.* Either it was overproofed (I'm leaning towards this, because of that alcoholic odour) or underbaked (although, as you can see, the top crust was edging into burnt territory), because some of the slices toward the end of the loaf became so squished by the pressure of my knife alone as I sliced it that they became inedible.

![tofu bread with huckleberry jam](/food/foodventures/images/tofu-bread-huckleberry-jam.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-left}

Honestly, it was a little gross! and I'm disappointed, because I was looking forward to some good strong bread to spread heaps of huckleberry jam on. Instead, I got loose, fragile crumbs that were barely strong enough to hold the bread itself together, nevermind a thick layer of jam.
