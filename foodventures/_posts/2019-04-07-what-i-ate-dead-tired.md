Look at that creamy batter!

That's right, I'm baking a cake from yesterday's discard from my sourdough starter. I didn't even know this was a thing, but apparently you can make sooo many things with [discarded starter](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/collections/sourdough-discard-recipes/). The recipe for the base of this chocolate cake is from [King Arthur Flour](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/sourdough-chocolate-cake-recipe), but I'm not going to use their icing. There's still a ton of cream "cheeze" icing leftover from when I baked my carrot cake, so I'm going to drizzle some onto this cake as well. It tastes so good with the carrot cake and on its own, frankly, I can't imagine why it wouldn't work for this cake too.

Well, it's early Saturday morning now as I'm writing this. Nothing like some midnight baking to relieve the stress of your job :-)

## Sunday:

I'm also preparing a vegan cheesecake with pistachio crust, recipe courtesy of [Sainsbury's](https://www.sainsburysmagazine.co.uk/recipes/desserts/raw-vegan-vanilla-strawberry-and-pistachio-cheesecake). It's going to go in the freezer overnight, and hopefully I'll wake up tomorrow to a delicious little breakfast!
