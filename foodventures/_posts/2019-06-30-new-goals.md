### Amish White Bread

Another day, another baking project, am I right?

![homemade amish white bread](/food/foodventures/images/amish-white-bread-1.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

I made Amish white bread today, recipe courtesy of [Kickass Baker](https://kickassbaker.com/classic-easy-homemade-amish-white-bread/). I was craving some slices from a simple white sandwich loaf, and I wanted one that I could make in my stand mixer.

Since I was testing this recipe out for the first time, I halved the ingredients to yield one loaf instead of two. Instead of active dry yeast, I used half a tablespoon of instant yeast. And I didn't really follow the instructions at all except for the ingredient ratios. Here's what I did:

1. Mix water, sugar, yeast, salt, and vegetable oil together in the bowl of a stand mixer.
1. Using dough hook attachment on low speed, slowly add in flour.
1. After all flour has been incorporated, continue to knead for 2–3 minutes or until the ball is smooth (see picture below).
1. Form into a ball and rest it for 1–1.5 hours inside the mixing bowl, covered with plastic wrap.
1. Scatter some flour or wheat bran (I used bran) onto the counter and turn the dough out. Flatten it into a long oblong shape and fold the top and bottom edges up towards the center. Now fold the two sides towards each other (like doing a hot dog fold.)
1. Drop the dough baby into a lined loaf pan. Cover with the same sheet of plastic wrap and let rest again, for 0.5–1 hour.
1. Bake at 350 °F for 30 minutes.

This dough is a dream to work with. See how soft and smooth it is? So wonderful to handle. Barely sticks to anything, so no need to grease the bowl while you let it rise. It's so easy and fun to make. I only wish I had remembered to scale down the recipe just a little bit to accommodate for my tiny loaf pan and tiny toaster oven. This bread ended up rising so much, way out of the pan, and in the oven, it rose even more and ended up hitting the top of the oven! I'm just glad that the upper heating element wasn't on, or the crust would be burnt to a crisp.

That's the reason you see a dent on the top of the bread, and the reason I had to take it out of the oven prematurely. The inside was a little undercooked, but still very edible. This dough was a great success, and I didn't even mind the slight gumminess on the inside because the rest of it is so soft and chewy. I can see this being a great recipe for buns too. I do wonder what makes it "Amish," though. It's different from Amish friendship bread, which involves a sourdough starter. The ingredients for this one are standard for any Italian bread, and I'm not really sure what it has to do with Amish people especially.

I love how simple this recipe is, and that it doesn't require any extra ingredients like milk or eggs. I might even try taking out the sugar when I make this again, because I think that's more for activating the yeast (which is unnecessary with instant yeast) than for taste purposes.

### Instant Pot Cheesecake

I also attempted an Instant Pot cheesecake for the first time. I was feeling bad about Kevin's birthday cake not working out, and he's been asking for a cheesecake for a while, so I decided to make this for him. This is another recipe I've had my eye on for a long time, because how cool is it to make cake in a pressure cooker?! It's a New York style cheesecake with no frills. Instead of graham cracker crumbs, I used the crust of the failed rum cake from [last week](/food/foodventures/sushi-and-carbs/#thursday-sushi-boat-at-kens-and-rum-cake), after breaking it up in my food processor. I also didn't have any sour cream on hand, so I blended together some cream cheese and milk until it reached the same consistency.

![instant pot new york style cheesecake](/food/foodventures/images/instant-pot-cheesecake-2.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-left}

I thought it was just ok. But it got Kevin's unreserved approval, which is huge! I'm pretty surprised, because as I said, it tastes fine to me but nothing special. I'm glad he likes it, though, because it was such an easy recipe and I'll be making this again and again.

Here's a picture of the cheesecake in the Instant Pot before the cook cycle. Looks pretty much the same before and after baking, right?

### Midterm Breakfast

![student association midterm breakfast](/food/foodventures/images/sbsa-midterm-breakfast.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}

SBSA (our program's student association) hosts a midterm breakfast every term that's basically a free food opportunity for science students. Since Kevin is VP this term, he had to arrive before the event started to help out. I tagged along for the food, lol. There was *so many* breakfast pastries, all provided by the Science C&D. I ate a billion calories because I wanted to try some of everything! I tried a chocolate covered bagel, a blueberry danish, and a chocolate eclair, and took a chocolate chip cookie and raspberry cookie home to eat later. These were some of the biggest cookies I've ever seen in my life :-0

### Reverse-Seared Steak

Even though cooking steak kinda intimidates me, I finally sucked it up this week and bought a couple of sirloin steaks at T&T. Kevin loves steak so I figured I should make it at least once in a while. I used the trendy reverse-sear method after reading [Kenji's guide on Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/2017/03/how-to-reverse-sear-best-way-to-cook-steak.html) about five times. This thing takes a looong time to slow cook in the oven, but the searing itself is lightning fast. About 45 seconds on each side and maybe 30 seconds for the edges. The result was pretty good for my first attempt. Kevin requested a medium steak, and the inside was good, but the outside

### Fried Onion Toasties

For my own dinner, I toasted up two slices of the bread I made [yesterday](/food/foodventures/new-goals/#amish-white-bread), topped with shredded cheddar and fried onions. I was expecting the cheese to melt more, like an open-faced toastie, but it kind of... stayed where it was? Disappointing, but then again I *am* using a low fat cheese so maybe it doesn't get as melty as regular cheese. The fried onions added a great undertone of flavour, though, so I think this is a really good combo for grilled cheeses.

### Marmite Toast

![marmite toast](/food/foodventures/images/marmite-toast.jpg){:width="35%"}{: .image-right}

Kevin went to Toronto this morning for a co-op interview, so no need to cook for two today. For breakfast, I ate something that he would *definitely* not be down for: marmite toast!! I've really intrigued by marmite and vegemite, and I want to find new ways to eat them on stuff. It occurred to me this morning that I've never actually eaten them the traditional way: on toast!

Well, this really put the structural integrity of my sandwich loaf to the test and it didn't quite measure up. The crumb was a bit too fragile and fell apart when I tried to spread the sticky marmite, resulting in some lovely uneven patches. Overall, I didn't find this experience enjoyable. Marmite is way too salty to be a spread and I would rate it a 4/10. My favourite application for them has got to be the cheesy vegemite scrolls I made back in March.

### Vegan Breakfast Burrito

![vegan breakfast burrito](/food/foodventures/images/vegan-breakfast-burrito.jpg){:width="35%"}{: .image-right}

Another ancient freezer find: these breakfast wraps I made at the beginning of second year when I was deeply obsessed with meal prep photos of humongous piles of foil-wrapped burritos. None of my freezer burritos have turned out very appetizing after they've been defrosted, and this one was no different. The ingredients in this include: black beans, sauteed potatoes and bell peppers, and nutritional yeast. I dunno guys, I still can't figure out why meal prep is so popular. Stuff just *doesn't taste good* after it's been frozen and defrosted. (I mean, there are exceptions, but I think this rule applies to 75% of things people try to freeze, which is higher than my university average right now...)

### Steamed Buns at Mr. Yin

![steamed buns at mr yin](/food/foodventures/images/mr-yin-steamed-bao.jpg){:width="45%"}{: .image-right}

Even though I've had a disappointing food day, not all is lost because I went for dinner after my lab with the Biotech girls :-)

There's a restaurant in the plaza, bordering University Ave, called Mr. Yin that sells charming dishes of Chinese food. Apparently, they offer half off on steamed buns after a certain hour, so we got all these bao for less than $5 all together! The ones on the right are Leek, Egg, and Shrimp; the ones are the left are Pork with Green Onion. The others also ordered a spicy chicken casserole to share (casserole really gives the wrong impression of what this is, btw, because it has nothing to do with being baked like Western casseroles. It's really a 砂锅, which I'm not sure how to translate to English, but involves stewing a flavourful dish in a Chinese earthenware pot. I don't own one of these traditional clay pots nor do I own a Dutch oven, so this comparison could be wrong, but I would say it's comparable to making a stew in a Dutch oven on the stove top.)

I was limited to eating the leek and shrimp bao because it was the only pescatarian item, but one bite in I discovered a problem: I hate leeks. I mean. This is not the first time in my life I've eaten a leek, but it *is* the first time in my life I've found out the English name for a vegetable I've despised with a passion since I was a young girl.

I'm talking about 韭菜! I have no memory of ever liking this vegetable at any age, and had a traumatic experience with having it forced fed to me and puking in a restaurant. Everyone else in my family (and all of China, it seems) loves the shit out of it. Luckily, my parents started taking my aversion seriously after the puking incident, so I haven't had it in a looong time, but every few months back home we have a family gathering where my grandparents get together and make a billion [韭菜饼, or Chinese leek pocket pies](https://redhousespice.com/chinese-chive-pockets/). They always have to make a special one for me with spring onions instead of leek. But see, I have never encountered this vegetable anywhere except at these family dinners, so I've never had a reason to find out its English name... until today.
