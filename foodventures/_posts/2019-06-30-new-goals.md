## Monday: Instant Pot Cheesecake and Amish White Bread

Another day, another baking project, am I right?

I made Amish white bread today, recipe courtesy of [Kickass Baker](https://kickassbaker.com/classic-easy-homemade-amish-white-bread/). I was craving some slices from a simple white sandwich loaf, and I wanted one that I could make in my stand mixer.

Since I was testing this recipe out for the first time, I halved the ingredients to yield one loaf instead of two. Instead of active dry yeast, I used half a tablespoon of instant yeast. And I didn't really follow the instructions at all except for the ingredient ratios. Here's what I did:

1. Mix water, sugar, yeast, salt, and vegetable oil together in the bowl of a stand mixer.
1. Using dough hook attachment on low speed, slowly add in flour.
1. After all flour has been incorporated, continue to knead for 2–3 minutes or until the ball is smooth (see picture below).
1. Form into a ball and rest it for 1–1.5 hours inside the mixing bowl, covered with plastic wrap.
1. Scatter some flour or wheat bran (I used bran) onto the counter and turn the dough out. Flatten it into a long oblong shape and fold the top and bottom edges up towards the center. Now fold the two sides towards each other (like doing a hot dog fold.)
1. Drop the dough baby into a lined loaf pan. Cover with the same sheet of plastic wrap and let rest again, for 0.5–1 hour.
1. Bake at 350 °F for 30 minutes.

This dough is a dream to work with. See how soft and smooth it is? So wonderful to handle. Barely sticks to anything, so no need to grease the bowl while you let it rise. It's so easy and fun to make. I only wish I had remembered to scale down the recipe just a little bit to accommodate for my tiny loaf pan and tiny toaster oven. This bread ended up rising so much, way out of the pan, and in the oven, it rose even more and ended up hitting the top of the oven! I'm just glad that the upper heating element wasn't on, or the crust would be burnt to a crisp.

That's the reason you see a dent on the top of the bread, and the reason I had to take it out of the oven prematurely. The inside was a little undercooked, but still very edible. This dough was a great success, and I didn't even mind the slight gumminess on the inside because the rest of it is so soft and chewy. I can see this being a great recipe for buns too. I do wonder what makes it "Amish," though. It's different from Amish friendship bread, which involves a sourdough starter. The ingredients for this one are standard for any Italian bread, and I'm not really sure what it has to do with Amish people especially.

I love how simple this recipe is, and that it doesn't require any extra ingredients like milk or eggs. I might even try taking out the sugar when I make this again, because I think that's more for activating the yeast (which is unnecessary with instant yeast) than for taste purposes.

I also attempted an Instant Pot cheesecake for the first time! This is another recipe I've had my eye on for a long time, because how cool is it to make cake in a pressure cooker?! It's a New York style cheesecake with no frills. Instead of graham cracker crumbs, I used the crust of my failed rum cake from [last week](/food/foodventures/sushi-and-carbs/#thursday-sushi-boat-at-kens-and-rum-cake), after breaking it up in my food processor. I also didn't have any sour cream on hand, so I blended together some cream cheese and milk until it reached the same consistency.

Results: delicious!

It doesn't look like much, but it got Kevin's approval, which is

Here's a picture of the cheesecake in the Instant Pot before the cook cycle. Looks pretty much the same before and after baking, right?
