## Thursday: Imola and Ravenna

### Gelateria Nord Pol

On the way back from the racetrack, we spotted a gelateria on the side of the road, and I couldn't resist. Did you know, this is the first time we've had gelato in Italy?! I can't tell you how many gelato shops we passed [in Milan](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-north-italy-edition-milan), but we never found the time to try any. This time, since we had loads of time to kill waiting for a train, we decided to sit down and enjoy some of Italy's most famous summer treat.

I bought a scoop of stracciatella in a cone, which Kevin liked a lot, to my surprise. He's not big on chocolate, so I was really not expecting that! He later went up to buy another one. We tried the "Nord Pol" special flavour,

### Dinner at Ristorante Ca' de Ven

Interestingly, this restaurant doesn't charge a *coperto* (cover fee).

## Friday: Bologna

### Dinner at Trattoria Da Me

The entire reason we made a reservation at this restaurant was to try their *lasagna alla bolognese,* which was good enough to have won a local television award and had been recommended by our Airbnb host. However, there's a tradition in the region of only eating lasagna for lunch on Sundays... and apparently, that's the only time most restaurants serve it, too. Unfortunately we missed out this time, but despite the disappointment, this was still one of our favourite meals in Bologna.

The star of the show was definitely the appetizer of *crescentines* (a thin, fried bread local to the region) with a board of mixed cold meats. Besides great lasagna and tagliatelle, Bologna is also home to many delicious cured meats, most famous of which is *mortadella* (better known as baloney, after "bologna," in North America).

The crescentines were delicious on their own, but paired with the cold cuts and some caramelized onions as a side, they became even better. Kevin was totally in love with every part of the dish, especially the mortadella.

After the mindblowing appetizers, the mains were almost a disappointment. Kevin got the tagliatelle alla bolognese, the next closest thing to lasagna. I had a taste and both he and I agreed that it tasted, well, just like a regular pasta, I suppose? No new flavours here, just a solid meal.

> Nothing special, [especially] after that appetizer. Wasn't bad tho.

â€“ Kevin

For my main, I ordered the *passatelli* with cold liquid escarole, black olives, and lemon. What were *passatelli?* I couldn't tell you, and there was no signal within the restaurant so I wasn't even able to google it. Hopefully this doesn't ruin *passatelli* for anyone, but when my food arrived at the table, I had the first impression of worms swimming in a green swamp. Don't get me wrong, it was quite yummy! Would I order it again? No, and not just because it looks unappetizing.

Like the [maltagliati](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-north-italy-edition-milan/#lunch-at-cantina-della-vetra) I had earlier in Milan, this dish contains pine nuts, but whereas the flavour of the earlier dish complemented the nuts very well, this one didn't. Every bite I took with pine nuts overwhelmed all other flavours. Furthermore, since they are made with breadcrumbs, the *passatelli* are dry and crumbly, almost like they are stale. Not exactly my favourite pasta texture, but the whole point of eating food in different countries is trying their local cuisine, and I definitely got to eat something that's very hard to come by back home. The sauce of escaroles, olives and lemons was wonderful, quite "homey," although I couldn't taste the lemon.

## Saturday: Modena and Maranello

A warning about traveling to Modena in August: *EVERYTHING IS CLOSED.* Despite being a small city, Modena is a culinary destination in Italy, known especially for its balsamic vinegar production but also for many fantastic restaurants, including *Osteria de Francesca,* one of the top restaurants in the world. It, in addition to what seems like every other restaurant in the entire city, was closed in mid-late August.

### Ice Cream at Gelateria K2

We were in Modena and its neighbouring town Maranello to visit the [Ferrari museums](#), and wanted to eat lunch in Modena after touring the museums. We couldn't find a single decent-looking restaurant open for business. Downtown Modena was very quiet even in the middle of the day; like Milan, it seems a lot of locals here take their vacations in August.

In desperation, we settled for some gelato, and bought some snacks from the [Coop](/food/foodventures/italian-junk-food) next to the train station.

My flavours: Spagnola (vanilla and cherry) and Zuppa Inglese. Yah, we're feeling international today!!

Kevin's flavours: tiramisu, amaretto, and crema.
