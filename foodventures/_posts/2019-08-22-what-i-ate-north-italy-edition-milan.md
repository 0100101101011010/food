### Late Lunch at Osteria di Brera

A mere five minutes' walk from our Airbnb, [Osteria di Brera](https://www.osteriadibrera.it/en/homepage-2/) was the perfect choice for our first meal in Italy. Even though it was past 4 pm when we arrived, several tables were still sitting around enjoying their food, which seemed to be a good sign.

We had no idea of what to expect from Italian dining customs, but I have to say, the most culture-shock part of this lunch came from the bread situation. After we placed our orders, our waiter brought forth a basket of bread and a jar of evoo. No plate, no bowl... we were really at a loss. It seemed that we were supposed to eat the bread with some oil, but how...? In the few North American restaurants that serve this combination, the olive oil is always brought over in a dish which you then dip bread into.

![bread with extra virgin olive oil](/food/foodventures/images/osteria-di-brera-bread.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right}

We speculated that one is either supposed to:

1. Pour olive oil directly over the piece of bread one is eating.
1. Drizzle the olive oil over the entire bread basket.

Both of these didn't seem to make a lot of sense, but I decided to try the first option. Total mess, dripped olive oil all over the tablecloth and my fingers. Bread tasted amazing though, the olive oil was very very virgin.

After this experience, we decided to google the question, and never found a consensus, but the likely answer is that the bread is not intended to be eaten on its own like an appetizer, but rather eaten with the main course. Never did figure out how to use the olive oil, though.

![mix di crudo (raw fish platter)](/food/foodventures/images/osteria-di-brera-mix-di-crudo.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}

I ordered a raw seafood platter, or *mix di crudo,* which cost about €35 (or roughly $50 CAD). There was SO MUCH FOOD. This is the only instance I can remember where I didn't finish a dish of raw fish, just because I was so stuffed. The shrimp was the best part of the meal, it was so tender and full of flavour, but not at all fishy. I wasn't so much a fan of the cubed fish (served in the spoons as seen in the photo): they were mixed with some olive oil and herbs and I found that the oil overwhelmed the pure taste of the fish.

[\*EDIT: It's now two days later, and I haven't suffered any gastrointestinal issues at all. I have some concerns of food poisoning or indigestion every time I eat so much raw seafood, but in this case everything was perfectly fresh.]

![risotto with shrimp and mollusc](/food/foodventures/images/osteria-di-brera-risotto-shrimp-mollusc.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-left}

Kevin got the risotto with shrimp and mollusc (€18), since risotto is one of Milan's specialties. He liked the rice and shrimp but found the molluscs too briny. I thought the flavour was okay, but tbh, I've never really cared for risotto. The rice is kind of hard and chalky to me, and even though I like dairy-rich dishes like Alfredo, I don't enjoy the taste of milk in risotto.

The only issue (aside from the bread that we didn't know how to eat) was the frankly terrible service. There was a single waiter and a busboy, so I would understand the slow service if it was during peak hours, but we came at a very slow time with not too many other patrons, and still it took ages just for us to get our water.

I love the European custom of non-tipping. Instead, restaurants here charge a flat-rate *coperto* (cover charge) based on the number of people in your party, usually €2–3 per person. I like this system a LOT more, because having to decide how big of a tip your server deserves is awkward, and it's annoying when you get a bad server but still need to tip because it's the norm.

### Shopping for Italian Junk Food at Eataly

![eataly food haul](/food/foodventures/images/eataly-1.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

After dinner, we walked over to Eataly. I remember being amazed by the Eataly in Rome the last time I'd visited Italy, so I told Kevin that this grocery store was absolutely worth a visit.

I'm trying to think of an analogous store in North America that readers can relate to, but tbh I don't think we have anything this high end and this big. Maybe a cross between a gourmet Costco and a not-completely-whole-foods Whole Foods?

I'll be going over the items we bought in detail in my [Italian junk food](/food/foodventures/italian-junk-food) post, coming soon!

## Sunday

### Lunch at Spontini Pizza

![spontini pizza](/food/foodventures/images/spontini-pizza-1.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

After walking around the city centre, visiting Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, and a couple other attractions in the Duomo area, we stopped by Spontini, a local pizza chain, to grab a quick bite for lunch.

The inside of this particular Spontini location is interesting, in that there are no chairs. The counters are made for you to eat while standing, not exactly a comfortable experience for long meals, but it works when you just want to wolf down a thick, greasy pizza slice and get on with your day.

![spontini pizza slices](/food/foodventures/images/spontini-pizza-2.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-left}

Although Milan and Northern Italy in general are not known for pizza, Spontini is a local institution, one of the oldest pizzerias around in the city. Unlike the thin-crusted, lightly-topped Neapolitan pizzas, the pies here are absolute units.

It's kinda funny to me because I've heard so much shit about how the thick-crusted pizza loved by Americans is a heavy, greasy abomination, but meanwhile the one we ate here in Milan is fatter than any North American pizza I've ever seen!

!["spontini 1953" pizza](/food/foodventures/images/spontini-pizza-3.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

We debated whether to order two individual slices or one large slice, but in the end, sharing turned out to be the correct option because those pizzas were *MASSIVE!* Sharing a single large slice (€6 each) was enough to fill us up for the next few hours.

We ordered the classic "Spontini 1953," which consists of their standard pizza base of tomato sauce, cheese, and dried basil, with the additional topping of anchovies. Of course Kevin stayed away from the anchovies as far as possible, and I ate them all up. They were so salty they made my mouth pucker, but 10/10 would eat them again.

Kevin and I both concluded that while tasty, it was not our fave, being so thick and cheesy you couldn't eat more than a slice without feeling sick. However, I loved the crust. It was golden brown, completely drenched in oil, and reminded me a little of the taste of *youtiao* (Chinese fried long donuts).

### Dinner at Dry

Since Kevin's pizza craving was not properly satisfied by Spontini, we made a reservation for dinner at [Dry](http://www.drymilano.it/), an upscale pizzeria and cocktail bar.

![fiori di zucca and margherita con bufala at dry milano](/food/foodventures/images/dry-pizza.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-left}

I ordered the *Fiori di Zucca* pizza (€12), with fior di latte cheese, lardo, zucchini flowers, scapece zucchini (fried and marinated slices of zucchini). Something got lost in translation here, because *lardo* had been written as *lard* on the English menu, so I wasn't expecting any actual pieces of meat on my pizza. When it arrived, however, there were bits and pieces of a bacon-like meat on top. *Lardo* turns out to be a thinly-sliced, very fatty cut of pork. I gave most of the pieces to Kevin, but I tried a couple as well. We both loved it! The meat is so thin, it melts in your mouth, but it is super rich and flavourful.

The rest of my pizza was wonderful too. I've never eaten zucchini floweres before (and honestly, I couldn't really taste them under the aromas of the lardo, zucchini and cheese), so it was interesting to see what that was like.

Kevin went with a classic *marghertia con bufala* (€9). He really enjoyed his as well. The crust at this location is very, very thin, a completely 180° from the [Spontini](#lunch-at-spontini-pizza) crusts. The only thing left uneaten on my plate was part of the outer crust, which I've never been a fan of on any pizza. (Although they look substantial in the photo, they were very light—mostly puffed up with air!)

![sorbetto al limone at dry milano](/food/foodventures/images/dry-sorbetto.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right}

I ordered a sorbetto *al limone* for dessert, thinking it would be some kind of drink. But, no, it was just a sorbet. Kevin and I shared it, with Kevin eating most of the sorbet portion (very citrusy and sour, just what he likes and what I don't) while I picked up the Graham cracker crumbs. The sorbet was just okay, we could've done without it, especially given how full we were after our pizzas.

Our food here came to €27.50 for a very filling dinner. Interesting to note, this place does not charge a *coperto* (cover fee), and it's on the cheaper side for water (€2 per bottle). Looking at the menu, we were initally shocked by the low prices, since Dry has a €€€ price level on Google Maps. No idea what they would consider low-price pizza then, because about $40 CAD for a respectable dinner with dessert sounds reasonable enough to me.


## Monday

### Lunch at Cantina della Vetra

We visited the [Colonne di San Lorenzo and Basilica San Lorenzo Maggiore](#) this afternoon and decided to find somewhere to eat nearby. The Cantina della Vetra was our closest restaurant, according to Google Maps, and it had good ratings, so we gave it a try.

![bread basket at cantina della vetra](/food/foodventures/images/cantina-della-vetra-bread.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-left}

We left with a very good impression. The menu at Cantina is fairly short, which makes ordering easy. It's also very detailed, with an extensive allergens list for each dish from gluten to celery, and a star beside the menu items in which some ingredients may be sourced from frozen (I only saw two dishes carrying this designation).

We shared a small bowl of potato chips (which were thin, crispy, and delicious), and a basket of complimentary bread (which were thick, tough, and hurt my teeth).

Kevin ordered the *risotto alla milanese* as per my suggestion.

I still don't like risotto, but this is my favourite risotto I've tasted so far. The flavours of the saffron and milk are very intense. When it first hit my mouth, I was like, "nah, not feeling this," but as I chewed, I began to enjoy it more and more! I went back for several more bites, and it actually seemed to get better with each mouthful.

![whole wheat maltagliati with with pesto at cantina della vetra](/food/foodventures/images/cantina-della-vetra-maltagliati.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

I ordered a dish of whole wheat maltagliati (a wide, flat pasta) with pine nuts and some vegetables, slathered in pesto. It came in a teeny tiny serving, which was unexpected but good, because we had a reservation to Contraste, the Michelin 1-star restaurant, later that evening, and I didn't want to be stuffed by the time dinner rolled around.

Again, the water here was very nice, but it was more expensive at €3 per bottle. Kevin and I are speculating that Milanese don't drink water from the tap and just buy bottled or filtered water, because the water at restaurants here is so much better than the water at our Airbnb (whereas in North America, all the water served at restaurants comes straight from the tap).

The service was also friendly. Like [Osteria di Brera](#late-lunch-at-osteria-di-brera), there was just one waiter around for the entire restaurant (although again we ate during a slow time, at 3 pm), but he provided much more attentive service than could be said for the former.

### Dinner at Contraste

Neither of us have eaten at a Michelin restaurant before, so we were both really excited for this experience. It got off to an... interesting start, for sure.

As soon as we took our seats, we were beset by mosquitoes. Between sitting down and receiving our first course, we got bitten seven times between the two of us! Obviously, it's totally understandable for there to be the occasional bug flying into the restaurant, and it's impossible for a restaurant to keep everything out. But seven times in something like ten minutes?! That's a serious disruption to the eating experience, especially when you consider that restaurants are judged based on the dining experience as well as the food itself. At least invest in one of those plug-in mosquito repellants or something? Because letting your patrons suffer itchy mosquito bites throughout a long dinner service is not okay.

Kevin let one of the servers know about the issue early on, but he didn't seem to take it seriously. After a few more mosquito bites, we were being driven crazy, and I was seriously considering up and leaving the restaurant. It seemed like every minute, Kevin was discovering a new bite somewhere on his body. I got another server's attention and asked to be taken to another table, which we figured was a long shot, but I didn't really know what else to do. Although she said no to the table change, this lady must've seen how close I was to losing it, because she quickly took us out to the lobby and—get this—handed us a can of bug spray. So yeah, there we were, sitting in the reception of a Michelin-starred restaurant, spraying bug spray on ourselves so we could eat dinner in peace. #highlightofmytrip

![contraste tasting menu](/food/foodventures/images/contraste-1.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right} ![contraste tasting menu](/food/foodventures/images/contraste-3.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

On the bright side, the server who handled our mosquito problem was nice about it and checked up on us throughout the meal to see if we were still being bothered. (The mosquitoes did go away after putting on bug spray.) Anyway, I might come back later to do a more in-depth write-up about the food, but I think the mosquitoes are a more interesting story.

![contraste tasting menu](/food/foodventures/images/contraste-2.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right} ![contraste tasting menu](/food/foodventures/images/contraste-4.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

We were served a tasting menu of over nine dishes, but these are the only photos I took. The experience overall (following the mosquito attack) was great, more reminiscent of viewing an art gallery than eating at a restaurant. Think of these photos as a little *antipasto* for a possible future review. :-)

## Tuesday

### Lunch at Gino Sorbillo Pizzeria

Our lunch spot today was hard to find. Although it's located in a bustling shopping area near the centre of Milan, it was pretty well-hidden by a bunch of construction scaffolding. Based on how massive the pizza looked (yes, even bigger than the ones at [Dry](#dinner-at-dry)), we ordered one to share between the two of us, especially since I wasn't all that hungry.

![gino sorbillo pizza](/food/foodventures/images/gino-sorbillo-pizza.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right} ![gino sorbillo pizza](/food/foodventures/images/gino-sorbillo-menu.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

I feel bad, because I wanted to order the "Pizza Tarallo Napoletano" Sorbillo - Leopoldo, even though I had no idea what it was. I thought it sounded interesting and exciting. Kevin wasn't too sure about it, but he agreed since I didn't want to eat the margherita pizza he suggested.

Well, it turns out *tarallo* is a Southern Italian breadstick-type thing, sort of like a hard pretzel. The pizza was basically breadcrumbs, almonds and a piece of tarallo over a peppery cheese. Don't get me wrong, I liked it, but Kevin really didn't. He didn't enjoy the almonds, nor did he appreciate how much cheese there was.

It was a bit of a downer for the afternoon, especially since he had been hungry and I was excited to take him to a nice pizza place where he could enjoy himself.

### Dinner at Temakinho

Temakinho is a chain of Italian restaraunts serving Brazilian-Japanese fusion. I've never heard of anyone combining those two cuisines, but it's a well-rated restaurant and we wanted to see what it was all about!

![salmão empanada temaki at temakinho](/food/foodventures/images/temakinho-salmon-empanada-temaki.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right} ![salmão abacate temaki at temakinho](/food/foodventures/images/temakinho-salmon-abacate-temaki.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

We each ordered a temaki, or hand roll, and a sushi roll. The Salmão Empanada temaki consisted of bread salmon salmon with lettuce, drizzled with teriyaki sauce and topped with almonds, rolled up with rice in a nori sheet. Kevin liked this one so much that we ordered another roll for takeaway. The Salmão Abacate temaki had more standard sushi ingredients, with raw salmon and avocado, and a touch of spicy mayo.

![violeta roll at temakinho](/food/foodventures/images/temakinho-violeta-roll.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-left}

My Violeta roll was really unique. It was a vegan roll of yam tempura and other veggies, complete with vegan roe (it tasted a bit like sago pearls in a savoury marinade, very interesting). The purple rice comes from staining with beetroot.

Kevin's Salmão Mexicano roll (not pictured) was wrapped in a cornmeal layer instead of your typical sushi rice, and filled with raw salmon, jalapeno peppers, flying fish roe, and some spicy mayo and cream cheese.

!["chopsticks" at temakinho](/food/foodventures/images/temakinho-chopsticks.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right}

We enjoyed our meal at Temakinho, but the highlight of the restaurant has to be these chopsticks. It's an ingenious design of "training" chopsticks that we've never seen before. The beauty of these cursed objects is that *you can't even use them like regular chopsticks.* Regardless of whether you have mastered chopsticks or not, you *must* squeeze them together in your hand like tongs rather than the traditional way of eating with chopsticks. Kevin was extremely offended.

## Wednesday

### Lunch at Paper Moon

At noon after visting the Duomo, all the restaurants on our shortlist were either closed or way too packed. So, we went with this restaurant that's in the very touristy shopping area near the city centre. You can tell that it's a bit more geared towards tourists, with slightly higher prices for everything

![tagliolini with shrimp and zucchini at paper moon](/food/foodventures/images/paper-moon-shrimp-zucchini-tagliolini.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right} ![margherita pizza at paper moon](/food/foodventures/images/paper-moon-margherita-pizza.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right}

Kevin's margherita pizza was very flimsy and floppy, and he didn't like that it came pre-cut into slices. My tagliolini with shrimp and zucchini tasted very good, but the two pieces of shrimp you see in the photo were the only pieces in the whole dish, which is dumb for a dish that costs €17. The bread, however (which I didn't take a picture of), was pretty yummy! Included were these thin long breadsticks which were pretty good on their own.

![tiramisu at paper moon](/food/foodventures/images/paper-moon-tiramisu.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right}

For dessert, we split the tiramisu, which was quite good. It's Kevin's favourite of all the ones we tried in Milan. The cocoa powder topping was very substantial on this one, achieving a bitter, chocolatey top layer that contrasts with the light, creamy bottom layers.

Our bill at Paper Moon came to €55, which is on the expensive side of our meals here.

### Dinner at Osteria Brunello

Our last dinner in the city was at Osteria Brunello, a restaurant known for serving up quality traditional Milanese food. Overall it was a wonderful meal to wrap up our trip to Milan. The only thing that put on damper on the experience is the number of street hawkers and beggars harrassing the people sitting outside. We also sat outside, but luckily near the inside corner, so we were insulated by the other tables. It was still very awkward to watch them repeatedly approached by people asking for money, selling cigarettes, offering photos with roses, etc...

![gazpacho appetizer at osteria brunello](/food/foodventures/images/osteria-brunello-gazpacho.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-left} ![bread at osteria brunello](/food/foodventures/images/osteria-brunello-bread.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-left}

We received a complimentary appetizer of watermelon gazpacho with soft cheese. The cheese was very strong, but it tasted good spread onto the bread. The watermelon gazpacho was an interesting flavour, but I don't like gazpacho very much so I didn't really enjoy this.

This bread basket is my favourite of all the restaurants that have provided bread so far. I love the slices of multigrain bread, which had a softer crust than most Italian bread, making them actually edible without breaking my teeth off.

![eggplant ravioli at osteria brunello](/food/foodventures/images/osteria-brunello-ravioli.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

My parmigiana di melanzane (eggplant and parmesan cheese) ravioli was delicious! The smoked provola cheese stew that it sat in was creamy and rich, but not cloying. The candied tomato provided a citrusy note, and the dried squash strips (I assume that's what those black-yellow sticks are, though tbh I couldn't tease the flavour from them) added some crunch. All in all, a lot of different tastes and textures going on here, but they manage to come together.

Kevin ordered what is ostensibly this restaurant's most famous dish, their [award-winning](https://www.gamberorosso.it/notizie/milano-2015-del-gambero-rosso-migliori-cucine-cantine-qualita-prezzo/) *cotoletta alla Milanese,* or cutlet in the Milanese style, a traditional Milanese main course which turns out to be a big cutlet of breaded veal. I tried a little bit and was kind of underwhelmed. It didn't taste like much. Just... meat and batter, which is what it is?

![cotoletta alla milanese at osteria brunello](/food/foodventures/images/osteria-brunello-cotoletta.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

Tbh, the most interesting part of the dish was the side salad of arugula and the accompanying mayonnaise. This mayonnaise was infused with arugula! Kevin and I are both strong arugula-haters, so obviously we weren't big on it, but I think it's kind of neat to have tried "arugula-flavoured" mayo. I never even knew mayo could have different flavours before. It's like a cursed ice cream.

> Hong Kong pork cutlet is better. This one is basically just meat battered and fried. It didn't taste [savoury.] Wasn't that good, very bland. The arugula was very bad and the sauce [was also infused with it] for some reason.

– Kevin

So as you can tell, he was a little disappointed as well.

![fior di latte ice cream at osteria brunello](/food/foodventures/images/osteria-brunello-ice-cream.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

For dessert, I ordered the fior di latte ice cream. I've always been intrigued by just how fior di latte would taste different from vanilla... I figured it would be like eating vanilla ice cream without the vanilla flavour, but I couldn't imagine what that would actually taste like. Well, I found out this evening that it is basically exactly what it sounds like: sweet ice cream with no distinct flavour. Not a real fan of this, even more boring than vanilla, will not be trying again.

![tiramisu at osteria brunello](/food/foodventures/images/osteria-brunello-tiramisu.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

Kevin's tiramisu, on the other hand, was delicious. It tastes very different from the [other](#) [tiramisus](#lunch-at-paper-moon) we've eaten so far. It was almost all mousse and cream, with no sponge layer, making it very light.

> There were chocolate shavings in it. It wasn't very bitter or super chocolatey. It was non-traditional, but tasted good.

– Kevin

Thanks for reading the first part of my Italy food blog! We're leaving Milan on Thursday for Bologna, where we'll be spending three days. I am *excited* for Bolognese food. Emilia-Romagna (the region where Bologna is the capital) is renowned for its deliciously rich cuisine, and hopefully we'll be able to experience it to the max. Watch out for my post soon. Ciao!
