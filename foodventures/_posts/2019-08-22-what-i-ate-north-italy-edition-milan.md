### Osteria di Brera

A mere five minutes' walk from our Airbnb, Osteria di Brera was the perfect choice for our first meal in Italy. Even though it was past 4 pm when we arrived, several tables were still sitting around enjoying their food, which seemed to be a good sign.

We had no idea of what to expect from Italian dining customs, but I have to say, the most culture-shock part of this lunch came from the bread situation. After we placed our orders, our waiter brought forth a basket of bread and a jar of evoo. No plate, no bowl... we were really at a loss. It seemed that we were supposed to eat the bread with some oil, but how...? In the few North American restaurants that serve this combination, the olive oil is always brought over in a dish which you then dip bread into.

We speculated that one is either supposed to:

1. Pour olive oil directly over the piece of bread one is eating.
1. Drizzle the olive oil over the entire bread basket.

Both of these didn't seem to make a lot of sense, but I decided to try the first option. Total mess, dripped olive oil all over the tablecloth and my fingers. Bread tasted amazing though, the olive oil was very very virgin.

After this experience, we decided to google the question, and never found a consensus, but the likely answer is that the bread is not intended to be eaten on its own like an appetizer, but rather eaten with the main course. Never did figure out how to use the olive oil, though.

![mix di crudo (raw fish platter)](/food/foodventures/images/osteria-di-brera-mix-di-crudo.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

I ordered a raw seafood platter, or *mix di crudo,* which cost about €35 (or roughly $50 CAD). There was SO MUCH FOOD. This is the only instance I can remember where I didn't finish a dish of raw fish, just because I was so stuffed. The shrimp was the best part of the meal, it was so tender and full of flavour, but not at all fishy. I wasn't so much a fan of the cubed fish (served in the spoons as seen in the photo): they were mixed with some olive oil and herbs and I found that the oil overwhelmed the pure taste of the fish.

[\*EDIT: It's now two days later, and I haven't suffered any gastrointestinal issues at all. I have some concerns of food poisoning or indigestion every time I eat so much raw seafood, but in this case everything was perfectly fresh.]

![risotto with shrimp and mollusc](/food/foodventures/images/osteria-di-brera-risotto-shrimp-mollusc.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

Kevin got the risotto with shrimp and mollusc (€18), since risotto is one of Milan's specialties. He liked the rice and shrimp but found the molluscs too briny. I thought the flavour was okay, but tbh, I've never really cared for risotto. The rice is kind of hard and chalky to me, and even though I like dairy-rich dishes like Alfredo, I don't enjoy the taste of milk in risotto.

The only issue (aside from the bread that we didn't know how to eat) was the frankly terrible service. There was a single waiter and a busboy, so I would understand the slow service if it was during peak hours, but we came at a very slow time with not too many other patrons, and still it took ages just for us to get our water.

I love the European custom of non-tipping. Instead, restaurants here charge a flat-rate *coperto* (cover charge) based on the number of people in your party, usually €2–3 per person. I like this system a LOT more, because having to decide how big of a tip your server deserves is awkward, and it's annoying when you get a bad server but still need to tip because it's the norm.

### Eataly

![eataly food haul](/food/foodventures/images/eataly-1.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

After dinner, we walked over to Eataly. I remembered being amazed by the Eataly in Rome the last time I'd visited Italy, so I told Kevin that this grocery store was absolutely worth a visit.

I'm trying to think of an analogous store in North America that readers can relate to, but tbh I don't think we have anything this high end and this big. Maybe a cross between a gourmet Costco and a not-completely-whole-foods Whole Foods?

I'll be going over the items we bought in detail in my [Italian junk food](/food/foodventures/italian-junk-food) post, coming soon!

### Lunch at Spontini Pizza

![spontini pizza](/food/foodventures/images/spontini-pizza-1.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

After walking around the city centre, visiting Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, and a couple other attractions in the Duomo area, we stopped by Spontini, Milan's own pizzeria, to grab a quick bite for lunch.

The inside of this particular Spontini location is interesting, in that there are no chairs. The counters are made for you to eat while standing, not exactly a comfortable experience for long meals, but it works when you just want to wolf down a thick, greasy pizza slice and get on with your day.

![spontini pizza slices](/food/foodventures/images/spontini-pizza-2.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-left}

Although Milan and Northern Italy in general are not known for pizza, Spontini is a local institution, one of the oldest pizza chains still around in the city. Unlike the thin-crusted, lightly-topped Neapolitan pizzas, the pies here are absolute units.

This is kinda funny to me because I've heard so much shit about how thick-crusted pizza is the greasy, bastardized American form of traditional Neapolitan pizza, but meanwhile the one here in Milan is fatter than any North American pizza I've ever seen!

!["spontini 1953" pizza](/food/foodventures/images/spontini-pizza-3.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

We debated whether to order two individual slices or one large slice, but in the end, sharing turned out to be the correct option because those pizzas were *MASSIVE!* Sharing a single large slice (€6 each) was enough to fill us up for the next few hours.

We ordered the classic "Spontini 1953," which is their standard pizza base of tomato sauce, cheese, and dried basil, with the additional topping of anchovies. Of course Kevin stayed away from the anchovies as far as possible, and I ate them all up. They were so salty they made my mouth pucker, but 10/10 would eat them again.

Kevin and I both concluded that while tasty, it was not our fave, being too greasy, cheesy, and thick. However, I loved the crust. It was golden brown, completely drenched in oil, and reminded me a little of the taste of *youtiao* (Chinese fried long donuts).

### Cantina della Vetra

We visited the [Colonne di San Lorenzo and Basilica San Lorenzo Maggiore](#) this afternoon and decided to find somewhere to eat nearby. The Cantina della Vetra was our closest restaurant, according to Google Maps, and it had good ratings, so we gave it a try.

We left with a very good impression. The menu at Cantina is fairly short, which makes ordering easy. It's also very detailed, with an extensive allergens list for each dish from gluten to celery, and a star beside the menu items in which some ingredients may be sourced from frozen (I only saw two dishes carrying this designation).

We shared a small bowl of potato chips (which were thin, crispy, and delicious), and a basket of complimentary bread (which were thick, tough, and hurt my teeth).

Kevin ordered the *risotto alla milanese* as per my suggestion.

I still don't like risotto, but this is my favourite risotto I've tasted so far. The flavours of the saffron and milk are very intense. When it first hit my mouth, I was like, "nah, not feeling this," but as I chewed, I began to enjoy it more and more! I went back for several more bites, and it actually seemed to get better with each mouthful.

I ordered a dish of whole wheat maltagliati (a wide, flat pasta) with pesto, pine nuts, and some other vegetables. It came in a teeny tiny serving, which was unexpected but good, because we have a reservation to Contraste, the Michelin 1-star restaurant, later this evening, and I didn't want to still be stuffed by the time dinner rolled around.

The flavour is most similar to the cookie part of an Oreo, but the texture is more crumbly.

Again, the water here was very nice, but it was more expensive at €3 per bottle. Kevin and I are speculating that Milanese don't drink the water from the tap and just buy bottled or filtered water, because the water at restaurants here is so much better than the water at our Airbnb (whereas in North America, all the water comes straight from the tap).
