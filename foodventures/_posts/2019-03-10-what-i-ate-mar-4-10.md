### Tea Eggs

Another batch of tea eggs today, using the same marinade as [last time](#). I don't know why I don't make these more often, they're such an easy snack and super healthy too. I pressure cooked the eggs in the Instant Pot for 3 minutes followed by a quick release, and dunked them into cold water straightaway. Then I marinated the eggs for two days. Yep, two whole days!

Even visually, you can see the improvement from my last batch. The flavour penetrated these better, due to the longer marinade process, and the eggs themselves were cooked better (I like a soft-boiled egg). I could probably cook these for a minute less still for a really gooey yolk.

### Black Bean Brownies with Peanut Butter Chips

Had some extra black beans, decided to make [brownies](https://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-gluten-free-black-bean-brownies/)! Ever since my first attempt at these back in fall term, I've been faintly obsessed with getting the perfect batch of bean brownies. The idea of using beans in baking just won't go away.

These weren't bad, but were a tad disappointing given the rave reviews on the recipe site about how "these are the best brownies ever." They were definitely *not* the best brownies ever. Better than no dessert at all, for sure, but they lack the rich taste, and chewy, fudgy texture that I want in a good brownie.

I think the peanut butter chips are a good idea, but I'll need to use more; this time, I simply sprinkled a couple on top, and the peanut butter flavour wasn't strong enough for me.

### Spinach Gnocchi Cheese Abomination

![spinach gnocchi fail](/food/foodventures/images/spinach-gnocchi-fail.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-left}

This is probably one of the most disgusting concoctions I have voluntarily put in my mouth.

I tried some of the [gnocchi](#) I'd frozen back in January. Didn't follow a recipe, just threw in some leftover canned corn and chopped up chunks of cheese. I don't even know. The nutmeg, oh my god, it was OVERWHELMING. The taste of the nutmeg instantly brought me back to a spiced cake or muffin, and the clash with the saltiness of the gnocchi, then with the finishing touch of *corn* of all things, made it inedible. I still gag thinking about this.

### Persimmon Walnut Cookies

Thank God, these turned out better than the gnocchi, or I'd be having a really bad day right now. Even though my last batch of persimmon cookies weren't stunning, I tried [a different recipe](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/10043/persimmon-cookies-i/) this time that worked much better. Lumpy and uneven, they are pretty rough to look at, but the walnuts and persimmon blend together in the buttery dough to make something pretty delicious.

### Vegan Spanish Rice in the Instant Pot

So far, every attempt I've made at cooking Spanish rice has been more or less unsuccessful. Yet the idea of this dish never fails to make me salivate. I guess it's the visual appeal of a brightly coloured rice dish filled with all sorts of deliciously fragrant vegetables---onions, bell peppers, tomatoes---that makes me think of flavourful Latin food.

The [recipe I used this time](https://www.brandnewvegan.com/recipes/instant-pot-spanish-rice) resulted in the rice being too soft, and just a bit too wet, turning the whole thing mushy. It's edible, for sure, but next time, I'd cook it the same way as making plain rice (ie. 6 minutes on High Pressure and 10 minutes natural release) to give it that nice *al dente* chew. I'd also add some more spice because it wasn't flavourful enough. Maybe some taco seasoning will help?
