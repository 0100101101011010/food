### Cinnamon Swirl Brioche with Shredded Coconut

![vegan cinnamon swirl brioche with shredded coconut](/food/foodventures/images/vegan-cinnamon-swirl-coconut-brioche-2.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

I found this recipe from [Lucy's Friendly Foods](https://lucysfriendlyfoods.com/2016/04/06/cinnamon-swirl-brioche/) via the /r/Breadit community. Although the recipe is for a vegan brioche, I happened to make it non-vegan by adding butter, since I don't have margarine at the moment. (I know, you're like, why didn't you just follow a regular dairy recipe then?! I was mostly trying out this recipe to see how successful my homemade soy milk is for making enriched doughs.) I also screwed up by adding maybe double or triple the cinnamon to the dough, so I omitted it from the actual "swirl" part. Instead, I rolled up sweetened dried coconut in the braids and prayed it would still turn out pretty.

Well, the braids I made were too fat, making them hard to twirl around each other more than once. The crumb was very dry, and coconut shreds fell everywhere when I sliced the loaf. And the thing [hit the top of the darn oven again](food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jun-17-23/#amish-white-bread)!

As I expected, the extra cinnamon made the whole loaf taste a little off. Instead of being concentrated in the swirls, so you get the contrasting of flavours between white bread and sweet cinnamon in one bite, it was spread uniformly throughout the bread.

It's more than edible, but it didn't live up to my expectations, considering how much butter I added. That's probably the fault of all my fuckups and not of the recipe itself, so I do plan on trying this one again. However, I'll skip the cinnamon and just add more shredded coconut instead (with some butter or margarine in the folds to hold it together). The coconut reminded me of a loaf I used to buy from T&T when I was younger, which contained a buttery coconut-custard mixture swirled into the slices. I haven't bought bread from T&T in over a month because I'm determined to make my own, but man do I miss those loafs! It would be one more thing off my bread checklist if I can find a way to mimic their delicious bread.

## Friday

### Butter Chicken

Another [cooking lesson I learned today](/food/til): one chicken breast is the perfect size for one large serving. Since I cooked two chicken breasts today, that's enough for two meals for Kevin. I'll probably cook the third one on Sunday, depending on whether or not he feels like eating butter chicken for three days straight.

## Saturday

### Brioche Dinner Rolls

![brioche buns with flax seed](/food/foodventures/images/brioche-buns-1.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

Since my confidence has been boosted by the easiness of Hokkaido milk buns, I tried brioche today for the first time. (\*EDIT: Ugh, I have serious short-term memory issues. I totally forgot about the cinnamon swirl "brioche" loaf I made on [Monday](#cinnamon-swirl-brioche). Even though I don't know what authentic brioche is supposed to taste like, I don't think the loaf I made then tasted anything like brioche. It wasn't very rich or buttery.)

The [recipe I used](https://betterwithlemon.com/2013/03/05/poor-mans-brioche/) is known as a "poor man's brioche," apparently because traditional brioche is a complicated two-day process involving overnight fermentation. This simpler recipe takes about the same time as Hokkaido milk bread. I made a few substitutions, such as using all purpose flour for bread flour, and soy milk and margarine for whole milk and butter. I also tried to substitute the egg with a flax egg, but made a mistake by using whole flax seeds.

I was expecting it to turn out more or less the same as milk bread, but

## Sunday

### Pho Ben Thanh Restaurant

We met up with some of Kevin's SBSA friends to celebrate Canada Day, starting with a pho dinner near Conestoga Mall.

I don't think I've been this excited over a single dish for a while. I love pho and haven't had it for over a year—in fact—this is the first time I'm eating pho in Ontario! My parents and I liked to eat out at this one pho restaurant in Calgary, [Pho Kim](https://www.phokimcalgary.com/), which was the only restaurant where I ordered the same thing every time: #11. (Even after I stopped eating most meat, I would still order this dish. My parents were more than happy to eat the beef from my bowl. The last time I ate there, though, I tried one of their vegetarian options, and oh my god is it delicious.)

Anyway, all this is to say I have been seriously missing pho for some time, so when I found out we were eating pho today I was so happy!

I was pretty hungry when we got to the restaurant, so I didn't remember to take a photo before chowing down. This is not exactly the best pho I've had in my life. In fact, it ranks pretty close to the bottom. Kevin and I ordered the same bowl so we could compare notes. First, we both agreed that the beef had a... *meaty* smell. Like how fish can have a "fishy" smell, in a bad way? In Chinese, we call it 肉腥 ("meat stink"). It's actually this odour that made it so easy for me to stop eating meat.

Even though I didn't eat any of the beef myself, the smell was obviously present in the soup and noodles. Don't get me wrong, the primary smell is still the delicious pho broth, but if you take a whiff the wrong way you'll smell the meat. Of course, it can't have been too bad, because Kevin still happily finished all of his (and my) beef, and we both slurped up the noodles. For a quick fix to a pho craving, this does the job, and I also appreciate that their smallest bowl, at just $9.99, is actually a reasonably sized portion, since most pho places have oversized servings even for the smallest size. I walked out of this place full but not stuffed.

However, the meaty smell definitely put a damper on my chances of coming back. The plating needs some work as well. There was a dried piece of cilantro stuck to the edge of my bowl and the sides of the bowl felt grimy and not quite clean. I'm surprised that this restaurant has a fairly [high rating](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pho+Ben+Thanh+Restaurant/@43.5034725,-80.5337952,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m10!1m2!2m1!1spho!3m6!1s0x0:0x13bf1abb9d559587!8m2!3d43.5034762!4d-80.5316091!9m1!1b1), so maybe it was just an off day. Whatever the case, the lack of any other pho places in the area makes me want to brew my own pho broth.


### Milkshake and Onion Rings at Mel's Diner

I ordered a butterscotch-malt milkshake and Kevin got a plate of onion rings. The food was decent but kinda overpriced imo.

The service has been pretty bad the last few times I've been here, whether it was for takeout or sit down. I don't expect servers at student-targeted restaurants to give much of an F about patrons, but the servers here REALLY don't give an F.
