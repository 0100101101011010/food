excerpt: "On Thursday, we traveled to Montreal for a small weekend getaway. No home cooking at all in this post! It's all delicious, unhealthy, ultra-fattening French food, and I hope you like reading about it as much as we loved eating it."

## Monday: Matsu Sushi and Onezo Bubble Tea

![matsu sushi](/food/foodventures/images/matsu-sushi-1.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}

We ate at the new restaurant beside [Izna](#) for dinner. Sushi is just one of the things that you can order at Matsu Sushi, which carries a full Japanese and Korean menu, with bibimbap and pajeon sharing space with udon and sashimi. Maybe not the most authentic sushi, with rolls like "Waterloo" and "Vancouver," and a bulgogi-stuffed roll which Kevin ordered.

He wasn't too impressed with his roll, but I enjoyed mine, which featured an edible soy wrapper with tempura shrimp and avocado fillings. The presentation could use more work, with the rolls a little messy and rice spilling out of one of them, which took away from my impression of the quality. Despite that, it was tasty and well-priced—not as upscale as Ken's, maybe closer to Watami, but just as tasty as either one—and the decor is cute, with furniture that looks new and clean. I hope this place actually manages to stay open for more than a year. (In the time I've been living here, I've witnessed the closing of two restaurants at this location in as many years.) I'm very happy to have another sushi option to choose from in the plaza, because I'm getting a little tired of Ken's.

Since we only ordered one roll each, we weren't that full after finishing up and stopped by Onezo for some boba.

I think this was only the third time I've ever ordered something from Onezo, even though it's been open for almost a year. We rarely come here despite being more than willing to walk the extra distance to Kung Fu Tea, because I can't stress how much my boyfriend hates the stuff from Onezo. However, he knows that I enjoy the pearls at this place, so I really appreciated that he was willing to give them another try.

Kevin's hate for Onezo isn't unfounded; many people agree their drinks are a bit weak and lacking in flavour compared to the more popular shops around here, like Coco or Sharetea, but I've always maintained that they make the best pearls. Whereas other places only offer the standard tapioca and sago pearls, in addition to a few jellies, Onezo carries an amazing selection of different tapioca pearls. So far, I've tried their cactus and crystal pearls, and I've enjoyed both.

This time, however, I didn't get any pearls with my drink, which was rice milk tea with fresh taro. Kevin ordered the brown sugar dirty milk tea (I swear every bbt place is hopping on this dirty milk latte thing after The Alley started the trend). He didn't like the drink itself, or the brown sugar tapioca—Onezo pearls have always been too soft and squidgy for his taste, although I personally prefer their chewy texture.

## Wednesday:

I didn't eat much on Tuesday, since I had to detox from the weekend of eating, so we're skipping straight to Wednesday folks. I discovered two forgotten bananas in the fridge this morning, luckily they hadn't fully turned brown but were on the way to getting there. Refrigerated bananas aren't so good for eating on their own anymore, so I tried to cook them two ways.

The first thing I tried was making banana fries. This recipe is stupid simple. Just cut your banana into roughly fry-like shapes and drop them into some hot oil. Surprisingly, they were pretty yummy, although as you can see, this is not a photogenic dish. However, you should use unripe bananas for this because they will hold their structure better. These bbs were almost too soft and fragile to scoop out of the oil.

Another unphotogenic recipe.
