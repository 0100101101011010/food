## Monday: Matsu Sushi and Onezo Bubble Tea

![matsu sushi](/food/foodventures/images/matsu-sushi-1.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}

We ate at the new restaurant beside [Izna](#) for dinner. Sushi is just one of the things that you can order at Matsu Sushi, which carries a full Japanese and Korean menu, with bibimbap and pajeon sharing space with udon and sashimi. Maybe not the most authentic sushi, with rolls like "Waterloo" and "Vancouver," and a bulgogi-stuffed roll which Kevin ordered.

He wasn't too impressed with his roll, but I enjoyed mine, which featured an edible soy wrapper with tempura shrimp and avocado fillings. The presentation could use more work, with the rolls a little messy and rice spilling out of one of them, which took away from my impression of the quality. Despite that, it was tasty and well-priced—not as upscale as Ken's, maybe closer to Watami, but just as tasty as either one—and the decor is cute, with furniture that looks new and clean. I hope this place actually manages to stay open for more than a year. (In the time I've been living here, I've witnessed the closing of two restaurants at this location in as many years.) I'm very happy to have another sushi option to choose from in the plaza, because I'm getting a little tired of Ken's.

Since we only ordered one roll each, we weren't that full after finishing up and stopped by Onezo for some boba.

![bubble tea from onezo](/food/foodventures/images/onezo-tapioca.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-left}

I think this was only the third time I've ever ordered something from Onezo, even though it's been open for almost a year. We rarely come here despite being more than willing to walk the extra distance to Kung Fu Tea, because I can't stress how much my boyfriend hates the stuff from Onezo. However, he knows that I enjoy the pearls at this place, so I really appreciated that he was willing to give them another try.

Kevin's hate for Onezo isn't unfounded; I agree their drinks are weak and lacking flavour compared to the more popular shops around here, like Coco or Sharetea, but there's no question *THEY MAKE THE BEST PEARLS* (you can fight me on this). Whereas other places only offer the standard tapioca and sago pearls, in addition to a few jellies, Onezo carries an amazing selection of different tapioca pearls. So far, I've tried their cactus and crystal pearls, and I've enjoyed both.

This time, however, I didn't get any pearls with my drink, which was rice milk tea with fresh taro. Kevin ordered the brown sugar dirty milk tea (I swear every bbt place is hopping on this dirty milk latte thing after The Alley started the trend). He didn't like the drink itself, or the brown sugar tapioca—Onezo pearls have always been too soft and squidgy for his taste, although I personally prefer their chewy texture.

I enjoyed my drink, but seriously, it's taro and rice milk, two things that I love. Not even Onezo would be able to mess that up for me.

## Wednesday: Bananananza, Camembert Cheese, Tomato Basil Pasta, and Artichokes

![banana fries](/food/foodventures/images/banana-fries.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-left}

I didn't eat much on Tuesday, since I had to detox from the weekend of eating, so we're skipping straight to Wednesday folks. I discovered two forgotten bananas in the fridge this morning, and luckily they hadn't fully turned brown, but were on the way to getting there. Refrigerated bananas aren't so good for eating on their own anymore, so I tried to cook them two ways.

The first thing I tried was making banana fries. This recipe is stupid simple: peel your bananas, cut them into roughly fry-like shapes and drop into some hot oil. Surprisingly, they were pretty yummy, although as you can see, this is not a photogenic dish. However, next time I would use unripe bananas for this because they will hold their structure better. These bbs were almost too soft and fragile to scoop out of the oil, and a little too mushy on the inside for my taste.

![2-ingredient banana pancakes](/food/foodventures/images/banana-pancakes-1.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-left}

Another unphotogenic meal. This [2-ingredient pancake recipe](https://www.reddit.com/r/1200isplenty/comments/bsuhzh/350_cal_brunch_dairyfree_pancakes/) (spoiler: the ingredients are eggs and bananas) ended up being harder to make than it looks. My bananas were hard to mash with just a fork, and after a lot of struggling, I gave up and just mixed them into the eggs, lumps and all. The texture was inconsistent because of this, with parts that were spongy and eggy and parts that were mushy. It reminded me of French toast. 6/10.

If I make this again, I'll do a bigger batch and blend it up in the food processor to make sure the batter is as smooth as possible. Also, maybe I'll use flax eggs instead to avoid that eggy flavour.

![wheel of camembert cheese](/food/foodventures/images/camembert-cheese.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}



For lunch, I had an entire wheel of camembert.

... I guess going to Montreal revived my love for cheese, which sucks because I'm expressly trying to reduce my dairy consumption! But I saw this beb in the grocery store and it looked so cute I couldn't resist picking one up to try it. Funnily enough, I had to do some research on camembert for my last microbio lab report. Did you know that the fungus used to age camembert cheese is called *Penicillium camemberti*? There is another fungus with the name *P. roqueforti*. In both cases, the cheese was named first!

This is my first time trying camembert (that I'm aware of. I've probably had it before on a cheese plate or something and never realized it). I have to say I prefer brie, it's more creamy and rich, and has a more melt-in-your-mouth feel. However, camembert is still enjoyable. On my top ten list for sure!

![tomato basil penne pasta](/food/foodventures/images/tomato-basil-pasta.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}

Dinner was penne pasta with homemade vegan tomato sauce, over steamed broccoli. First time steaming broccoli in the Instant Pot. They came out slightly undercooked, so next time I'll let the pressure release naturally for a bit and see if that works out.

The pasta sauce (I used a cashew-based recipe from [Amy Le Creations](https://amylecreations.com/vegan-tomato-basil-cream-pasta/)) was disappointing. I think I've been spoiled by Isa Chandra's amazing [roasted red pepper sauce](https://www.isachandra.com/2013/10/roasted-red-pepper-mac-cheese-video/), because every vegan sauce I've made since then hasn't come close. There was just no real... flavour to this one. I might as well have been eating canned tomato sauce straight out of the tin.

![artichokes](/food/foodventures/images/artichokes-1.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-left}

As a snack since I was hungry at night, I had a small glass jar of artichokes in olive oil. This felt really sad to eat, cause, idk, it feels wrong to eat artichokes straight out of the jar without any dressing up, but I used to do this all the time at home when we had the big jar of marinated artichokes from Costco. It weirdly made me feel kind of homesick. I haven't had artichokes in a long time and they have been missed. :')

## Thursday: Sushi Boat at Ken's and Rum Cake

*IT'S KEVIN'S BIRTHDAY TODAY!* My baby finally turned two decades old and I went out with him and a friend to celebrate at Ken's Sushi. This is my first time ordering a sushi boat from there and wow, I was pretty impressed!

![sushi boat from ken's sushi](/food/foodventures/images/kens-sushi-boat.jpg){:width="100%"}{: .image-left}

Something about seeing all that sushi and sashimi piled up on one tray, waiting to be eaten, is super satisfying. Stuff like this is the reason I can't lose weight.

![rum cake batter](/food/foodventures/images/rum-cake-batter.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-left}

Kevin has been obsessed with rum and cokes lately, so I tried making him a birthday rum cake using a recipe from [Pass the Sushi](https://passthesushi.com/rum-cake-recipe-handed-down-for-mothers-day-flavorstory-giveaway/). Doesn't that batter look creamy and wonderful? Omg, it smelled delicious too. The friend of one of my roommates even commented on how good it smelled as it was baking in the oven.

Don't get too excited, because it was a spectacular failure. Although the outside of the cake was baked into a perfect golden crust, it was completely undercooked in the middle and collapsed when I was transferring it out of the pan. When the inside fell out as I was flipping the cake onto a plate, my heart had never dropped harder.

![failed attempt at rum cake](/food/foodventures/images/rum-cake-failure.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}

After we both ate most of the outer crust, I put the rest back into the oven to see if an extra 20 minutes would help. Nope. Once again, it cooked the parts that were on the outside, but everything on the inside was still as wet and underbaked as ever. I'm scratching my head at this one. I didn't skimp on any ingredients for this recipe, and the only change I made was subbing in hazelnut extract for almond extract because I didn't have the latter on hand.

Kevin was the sweetest and kept insisting that it tasted good despite the ugly presentation (and the crusty outer parts *were* pretty good—you know, the parts that were actually cooked through), and I so appreciate it. If he hadn't been so supportive, I would've felt terrible for not being able to make him a delicious cake for his birthday. On the bright side, I am definitely going to make it up to him with a homemade cheesecake soon.

![used up bags of sugar, flour, and butter](/food/foodventures/images/used-up-ingredients.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

Another milestone that happened today was my simultaneous finishing of a bag of sugar, flour *and* jar of butter! Yep, I was pretty surprised at how perfectly everything worked out. This is my first time using up an entire bag of all purpose flour, and it's a strange feeling of... accomplishment? Yeah, I'm proud of this, LOL. But now I have to lug back a 10 kg bag of flour from the grocery store on my next trip. Ugh.

## Friday:

![salami pizza](/food/foodventures/images/salami-pizza.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}


A simple salami pizza today for Kevin's dinner. I defrosted a ball of the dough [I made a couple weeks ago](/food/foodventures/short-week/). Then I rolled it out and baked the crust by itself for about ten minutes (until the edges were *just* beginning to deepen in colour), before spreading on a layer of tomato sauce and bbq sauce and topping it with mozzarella and sliced salami. It smelled *so amazing* pulling it out of the oven, I couldn't help trying a slice, and guys, this is my favourite homemade pizza so far. Something about that salami and the sweet undertone of the bbq sauce... mmm.

The bf didn't seem as impressed as I was, commenting that the dough could be less thick and I should add a few varieties of meat toppings next time instead of just the one. He also pointed out that the salami slices were too large and unwieldy to chew conveniently, so next time I think I'll slice them into halves.

## Sunday: Pizza

![pizza dough](/food/foodventures/images/pizza-dough-1.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

Here's a picture of the batch of pizza dough before rolling them out. Scary how much dough can rise in an hour, right?

Confession: this was not meant to be pizza dough. I tried to make hot dog buns today, but for some reason the dough just would *not* form a smooth ball in the mixer. I was afraid of over-kneading it, so I stopped the mixer while it was still quite shaggy. After rising, it was still very loose, sticky, and too unmanageable to work into bun shapes, so I said fuck it and divided them into pizza dough balls. I froze
