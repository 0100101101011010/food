## Sunday

### Lunch at Osteria al Duomo

After we dropped off our luggage at our hotel in Murano, a little island about a five-minute's boat ride from Venice proper (and I [totally recommend staying here](/blog/italy-trip-venice-bologna-milan/#) instead of the main island, btw), we didn't feel like venturing too far out for dinner. Luckily, Osteria al Duomo was literally a bridge away from the hotel, and it had good ratings on Google Maps.

Funnily enough, despite the city's strong ties to water, Venice isn't renowned for great seafood. That's not to say it isn't one of the key elements of Venetian cuisineâ€”a lot of traditional meals are based around its lagoon species, like cuttlefish, clams, and shrimp. But they aren't as universally popular as, say, Japanese sashimi or Maine lobster. Many of the dishes here, including the cuttlefish *alla Veneziana* I ordered, for example can be described as an "acquired taste."

So what is cuttlefish "in the Venetian style," exactly? Well, basically it's a method of preparation the cuttlefish ink itself is used in the sauce, creating a jet-black mass that honestly does not look appetizing. And it stains your entire mouth black!

I'm not one to be grossed out by the colour or anything like that, but the sauce was not good at all. Very thin, not savoury, not flavourfulâ€”just kind of salty. And it left a not-too-pleasant aftertaste in my mouth. The polenta was decentâ€”reminded me of arepas, tbhâ€”but didn't pair well with the cuttlefish sauce.

Oh! and I totally forgot to mention one other issue that put a damper on the meal, at no fault of the restaurant. You see, we chose to sit outside for some stupid reason, not having applied bug spray beforehand, and you can guess what happened!! It was [Contraste](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-north-italy-edition-milan/#dinner-at-contraste) all over again! We were eaten alive by mosquitoes, and both of us couldn't finish our meal fast enough before we hightailed it out of there.

## Monday

### Lunch at

### Dinner at Il Ridotto

The chef was very involved here, stopping by our table after we left the raw beef tartare barely eaten. He also personally served a few of the dishes.

## Tuesday

### Lunch at La Zucca

## Wednesday

### Lunch, Take 2 at Osteria al Duomo

Remember the restaurant where we were [massacred by mosquitoes](#lunch-at-osteria-al-duomo)? We decided to give them another try since neither of us had been in the right state of mind to enjoy our meal the last time around.

Sadly this time wasn't too great, either. I have to conclude that although the restaurant has a lengthy history, having been established in 1903 (that's earlier than Alberta became a province... omg), the food itself is average.

## Thursday

### Dinner at Trattoria da Romano

We shared the *Risotto da Romano*

This place also has the softest bread we encountered yet in Italy.

## Friday

### Lunch at Rossopomodoro Pizzeria

The service was friendly, but slow (and I don't mean that it was relaxed, in the typical Italian way, but rather that there didn't seem to be enough servers and we always had to wait for them to deal with two or three other issues before they got to us).

## Saturday

### Lunch on Air Canada Rouge
