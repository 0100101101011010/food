## Sunday

### Lunch at Osteria al Duomo

After we dropped off our luggage at our hotel in Murano, a little island about a five-minute's boat ride from Venice proper (and I [totally recommend staying here](/blog/italy-trip-venice-bologna-milan/#) instead of the main island, btw), we didn't feel like venturing too far out for dinner. Luckily, Osteria al Duomo was literally a bridge away from the hotel, and it had good ratings on Google Maps.

![cuttlefish with polenta from osteria al duomo](/food/foodventures/images/osteria-al-duomo-cuttlefish.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

Funnily enough, despite the city's strong ties to water, Venice isn't renowned for great seafood. That's not to say it isn't one of the key elements of Venetian cuisineâ€”a lot of traditional meals are based around its lagoon species, like cuttlefish, clams, and shrimp. But they aren't as universally popular as, say, Japanese sashimi or Maine lobster. Many of the dishes here, including the cuttlefish *alla Veneziana* I ordered, for example can be described as an "acquired taste."

So what is cuttlefish "in the Venetian style," exactly? Well, basically it's a method of preparation the cuttlefish ink itself is used in the sauce, creating a jet-black mass that honestly does not look appetizing. And it stains your entire mouth black!

I'm not one to be grossed out by the colour or anything like that, but the sauce was not good at all. Very thin, not savoury, not flavourfulâ€”just kind of salty. And it left a not-too-pleasant aftertaste in my mouth. The polenta was decentâ€”reminded me of arepasâ€”but didn't pair well with the cuttlefish sauce.

Oh! and I totally forgot to mention one other issue that put a damper on the meal, at no fault of the restaurant. You see, we chose to sit outside for some stupid reason, not having applied bug spray beforehand, and you can guess what happened!! It was [Contraste](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-north-italy-edition-milan/#dinner-at-contraste) all over again! We were eaten alive by mosquitoes, and both of us couldn't finish our meal fast enough before we hightailed it out of there. So yeah, it's highly possible I could've enjoyed the food more, and spent more time finding something to like about it, were I not fending off mosquitoes for the whole thing.

## Monday

### Lunch at Versus Meridianem

Probably the most memorable aspect of this restaurant is its setting. It's located right on the tip of Murano, in a former glass factory (did you know our hotel also used to be a glass factory? Chances are, any old brick building you see on Murano will have been a glass factory). The huge floor-to-ceiling windows give you a great view out onto the water. It's a nice spot to have a lunch while enjoying the sun and waves and watch boats zipping by, even though the food is not as exciting.

![spaghetti alla busara at versus meridianem](/food/foodventures/images/versus-meridianem-spaghetti.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

I ordered the spaghetti *alla busara* ("with langoustines", a species similar to crayfish that is local to Veneto), which just tastes like a regular tomato sauce spaghetti that I could whip up at home, with a few chunks of seafood thrown in. It was pretty expensive (â‚¬16), but then again, the portion was huge and I could barely finish it.

Kevin ordered a pizza, I don't recall the name, but I do remember being in awe at how much meat was on the thing. So, maybe it wasn't an authentic Venetian dish, but he had a good time. :-)

### Dinner at Il Ridotto

Il Ridotto was the [second](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-north-italy-edition-milan/#dinner-at-contraste) of our Michelin-star reservations planned for this trip.

Again, we opted for the tasting menu here, but to our disappointment, we both had to order the exact same things and there was no individualized accommodations. Obviously, Kevin would miss out if I were to ask for a meatless menu, so I had to take the items with meat as well. (Luckily, this didn't turn out to be a big problem because Kevin was happy to eat up my servings if they had meat in them!)

![il ridotto bread](/food/foodventures/images/il-ridotto-bread.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-left}

Before we get to the courses, though, let me touch on the bread. This was possibly some of the *hardest, crustiest bread* we had encountered in all our travels. It was quite dense as well, with a tight crumb, which I didn't mind honestly because I like a substantial bread! But did the crust have to be so tough and unchewable??

It was paired with a nice extra virgin olive oil that, although smelling very nice, was super bitter. But I guess I have to be grateful that they actually provided a plate here to pour the olive oil in, unlike our first [disastrous encounter with bread and olive oil](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-north-italy-edition-milan/#late-lunch-at-osteria-di-brera) in Milan.

![il ridotto amuse-bouche](/food/foodventures/images/il-ridotto-amuse-bouche.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right}

We soon received an amuse-bouche, and sadly I can't say much about it because I don't remember anything of the taste except tomato sauce. I want to say it was a quiche, or some kind of bread or possibly polenta?

LOL moving on!!

![il ridotto scallop noodles](/food/foodventures/images/il-ridotto-scallop-noodles.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-left}

I didn't know it was so popular to create noodles out of seafood, but we ate a similar dish at [Contraste](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-north-italy-edition-milan/#dinner-at-contraste). I wanna say that this one is also made out of raw scallops, but I don't remember. Anyway, it even tasted quite similar to the one at Contraste, and I enjoyed it a lot. The little bit of acidity brought on by some-kind-of-pickle-or-other went perfectly with the noodles.

![il ridotto steak tartare](/food/foodventures/images/il-ridotto-beef-tartare.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

Oof... now this one was not good. Two balls of raw ground beef. I have never eaten raw beef before except in Japanese tataki (which I think is more rare than raw, anyway), and I was not prepared for this. The flavour of this thing is one of the reasons I find it so easy to avoid meatâ€”fatty, strong, a little gameyâ€”let's just say it was not at all subtle about being completely raw. Even Kevin couldn't eat much of it.

Aside from the meat itself, the other parts of the dish were fineâ€”the truffle and parmigiano reggiano garnishes were delicious, and mmm, that slice of tomato with the fresh slice of basil, it was heaven! If we'd been served two balls of that tomato on its own, I wouldn't have minded.

It was a little awkward when the server came to take away our barely touched plates. But next thing we knew, the chef himself came out. He seemed very apologetic, and then let us know the next few dishes with meat and asked if we were okay with them. I really appreciate that he stopped by, since that meant diners' remarks are actually passed on to the kitchen, and it showed that at least our experience was acknowledged.

![il ridotto red pepper risotto](/food/foodventures/images/il-ridotto-risotto.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

Luckily, the next dish was absolutely delicious.

It looks kind of rustic, but oh man, at this point of our trip I had not yet tasted risotto this good. I had never heard of, let alone tasted, red pepper risotto with capers, but it's a winning combination! This may actually be my first time (knowingly) eating capers, as well. The tart, almost lemony note introduced by the capers worked so well with the hearty risotto. And the cheese, don't get me started on the cheese! The mozzarella di bufala was so fresh, tender, and juicy. *I WANTED MORE!!!*

He also personally served a few of the dishes.

## Tuesday

### Lunch at La Zucca

*La zucca* means "the squash" in Italian. So of course, I ordered their pumpkin entree.

## Wednesday

### Lunch, Take 2 at Osteria al Duomo

Remember the restaurant where we were [massacred by mosquitoes](#lunch-at-osteria-al-duomo)? We decided to give them another try since neither of us had been in the right state of mind to enjoy our meal the last time around.

Sadly this time wasn't too great, either. I have to conclude that although the restaurant has a lengthy history, having been established in 1903 (that's earlier than Alberta became a province... omg), the food itself is average.

We made sure to shower in bug spray before we went, so mosquitoes weren't a problem. However, this time, there was a weird smell near where we were sitting and it really wasn't pleasant to smell right before a meal.

The entrees themselves were ok, I ordered a linguine with pistachio pesto dish. I liked the subtle flavours, but it wasn't salted enough, and I would've like more of the pistachio to come through.

Kevin's marinara pizza was really funny! It was a totally bare pizza, with just ~~tomato~~ marinara sauce and two whole cloves of garlic in the centre. This guy loved it, though, so who am I to judge :-)

## Thursday

For Thursday we decided to take a day trip to Burano (which always makes me laugh, 'cause Burano, Murano...) and holy shit this is the prettiest little village ever.

### Dinner at Trattoria da Romano

We shared the *Risotto da Romano*, which blew both our minds. I have never tasted a flavour more suited to risotto!

I was afraid Kevin would find it fishy, but he loved it too. Sadly, it was also super expensive, at â‚¬20 per person. And we weren't even completely full after licking our plates clean, so we ordered a fried seafood platter to share.

Again, although delicious, the portions were small.

The polenta here was made with white cornmeal rather than the yellow cornmeal at [Osteria al Duomo](#lunch-at-osteria-al-duomo). Both of them tasted pretty similar tbh. How is white cornmeal even made?!

This place also has the softest bread we encountered yet in Italy, another bonus.

## Friday

### Lunch at Rossopomodoro Pizzeria

The service was friendly, but slow (and I don't mean that it was relaxed, in the typical Italian way, but rather that there didn't seem to be enough servers and we always had to wait for them to deal with two or three other issues before they got to us).

## Saturday

### Lunch on Air Canada Rouge

Ironically, we got better meals on Rouge than on the main Air Canada line that we flew in on.
