## Sunday

### Lunch at Osteria al Duomo

After we dropped off our luggage at our hotel in Murano, a little island about a five-minute's boat ride from Venice proper (and I [totally recommend staying here](/blog/italy-trip-venice-bologna-milan/#) instead of the main island, btw), we didn't feel like venturing too far out for dinner. Luckily, Osteria al Duomo was literally a bridge away from the hotel, and it had good ratings on Google Maps.

![cuttlefish with polenta from osteria al duomo](/food/foodventures/images/osteria-al-duomo-cuttlefish.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

Funnily enough, despite the city's strong ties to water, Venice isn't renowned for great seafood. That's not to say it isn't one of the key elements of Venetian cuisineâ€”a lot of traditional meals are based around its lagoon species, like cuttlefish, clams, and shrimp. But they aren't as universally popular as, say, Japanese sashimi or Maine lobster. Many of the dishes here, including the cuttlefish *alla Veneziana* I ordered, for example can be described as an "acquired taste."

So what is cuttlefish "in the Venetian style," exactly? Well, basically it's a method of preparation the cuttlefish ink itself is used in the sauce, creating a jet-black mass that honestly does not look appetizing. And it stains your entire mouth black!

I'm not one to be grossed out by the colour or anything like that, but the sauce was not good at all. Very thin, not savoury, not flavourfulâ€”just kind of salty. And it left a not-too-pleasant aftertaste in my mouth. The polenta was decentâ€”reminded me of arepasâ€”but didn't pair well with the cuttlefish sauce.

Oh! and I totally forgot to mention one other issue that put a damper on the meal, at no fault of the restaurant. You see, we chose to sit outside for some stupid reason, not having applied bug spray beforehand, and you can guess what happened!! It was [Contraste](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-north-italy-edition-milan/#dinner-at-contraste) all over again! We were eaten alive by mosquitoes, and both of us couldn't finish our meal fast enough before we hightailed it out of there. So yeah, it's highly possible I could've enjoyed the food more, and spent more time finding something to like about it, were I not fending off mosquitoes for the whole thing.

## Monday

### Lunch at Versus Meridianem

Probably the most memorable aspect of this restaurant is its setting. It's located right on the tip of Murano, in a former glass factory (did you know our hotel also used to be a glass factory? Chances are, any old brick building you see in Murano was formerly a glass factory). The huge floor-to-ceiling windows give you a great view out onto the water. It's a nice spot to have a lunch while enjoying the sun and waves and watch boats zipping by, even though the food is not as exciting.

![spaghetti alla busara at versus meridianem](/food/foodventures/images/versus-meridianem-spaghetti.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right} ![spaghetti alla busara at versus meridianem](/food/foodventures/images/versus-meridianem-pizza.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

I ordered the spaghetti *alla busara* ("with langoustines", a species similar to crayfish that is local to Veneto). It tasted like a regular tomato sauce spaghetti that I could whip up at home, with a few chunks of seafood thrown in. It was pretty expensive (â‚¬16), but then again, the portion was huge and I could barely finish it.

Kevin ordered a pizza, I don't recall the name, but I do remember being in awe at how much meat was on the thing. Maybe it wasn't a classic Venetian dish, but I know he had a good time with all that meat.

### Dinner at Il Ridotto

Il Ridotto was the [second](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-north-italy-edition-milan/#dinner-at-contraste) of our Michelin-star reservations planned for this trip.

Again, we opted for the tasting menu here, but to our disappointment, we both had to order the exact same things and there was no individualized accommodations. Obviously, Kevin would miss out if I were to ask for a meatless menu, so I had to take the items with meat as well. (Luckily, this didn't turn out to be a big problem because Kevin was happy to eat up my servings if they had meat in them!)

![il ridotto bread](/food/foodventures/images/il-ridotto-bread.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-left}

Before we get to the courses, though, let me touch on the bread. This was possibly some of the *hardest, crustiest bread* we had encountered in all our travels. It was quite dense as well, with a tight crumb, which I didn't mind honestly because I like a substantial bread! But did the crust have to be so tough and unchewable??

It was paired with a nice extra virgin olive oil that, although smelling very nice, was super bitter. But I guess I have to be grateful that they actually provided a plate here to pour the olive oil in, unlike our first [disastrous encounter with bread and olive oil](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-north-italy-edition-milan/#late-lunch-at-osteria-di-brera) in Milan.

![il ridotto amuse-bouche](/food/foodventures/images/il-ridotto-amuse-bouche.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right}

We soon received an amuse-bouche, and sadly I can't say much about it because I don't remember anything of the taste except tomato sauce. I want to say it was a quiche, or some kind of bread or possibly polenta?

LOL moving on!!

![il ridotto scallop noodles](/food/foodventures/images/il-ridotto-scallop-noodles.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-left}

I didn't know it was so popular to create noodles out of seafood, but we ate a similar dish at [Contraste](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-north-italy-edition-milan/#dinner-at-contraste). I wanna say that this one is also made out of raw scallops, but I don't remember. Anyway, it even tasted quite similar to the one at Contraste, and I enjoyed it a lot. The little bit of acidity brought on by some-kind-of-pickle-or-other went perfectly with the noodles.

![il ridotto steak tartare](/food/foodventures/images/il-ridotto-beef-tartare.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

Oof... now this one was not good. Two balls of raw ground beef. I have never eaten raw beef before except in Japanese tataki (which I think is more rare than raw, anyway), and I was not prepared for this. The flavour of this thing is one of the reasons I find it so easy to avoid meatâ€”fatty, strong, a little gameyâ€”let's just say it was not at all subtle about being completely raw. Even Kevin couldn't eat much of it.

Aside from the meat itself, the other parts of the dish were fineâ€”the truffle and parmigiano reggiano garnishes were delicious, and mmm, that slice of tomato with the fresh slice of basil, it was heaven! If we'd been served two balls of that tomato on its own, I wouldn't have minded.

It was a little awkward when the server came to take away our barely touched plates. But next thing we knew, the chef himself came out. He seemed very apologetic, and then let us know the next few dishes with meat and asked if we were okay with them. I really appreciate that he stopped by, since that meant diners' remarks are actually passed on to the kitchen, and it showed that at least our experience was acknowledged.

![il ridotto red pepper risotto](/food/foodventures/images/il-ridotto-risotto.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

Luckily, the next dish was absolutely delicious.

It looks kind of rustic, but oh man, at this point of our trip I had not yet tasted risotto this good. I had never heard of, let alone tasted, red pepper risotto with capers, but it's a winning combination! This may actually be my first time (knowingly) eating capers, as well. The tart, almost lemony note introduced by the capers worked so well with the hearty risotto. And the cheese, don't get me started on the cheese! The mozzarella di bufala was so fresh, tender, and juicy. *I WANTED MORE!!!*

![il ridotto beef tripe stew with beans](/food/foodventures/images/il-ridotto-tripe-beans.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right}

I rarely use this word because sometimes I'm not sure what it means, but I can 100% say the taste of this next dish is the definition of rustic. It was a hearty, warm stew with beef tripe and kidney beans. Kevin ate all the tripe and I ate all the beans :-P As someone who has rarely eaten tripe outside of pho (which is a really low standard, I know), I was surprised by how tender and lovely the tripe was. Still wasn't enough to make me take more than a bite, though.

![il ridotto pork belly, mashed potatoes, and green beans](/food/foodventures/images/il-ridotto-pork-belly-potatoes-green-beans.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-left}

Kevin loved this next dish, which is some sort of meat with pork belly, mashed potatoes, and a bundle of green beans, although the only things I ate were the potatoes (delicious) and beans (not very flavourful).

I don't remember much about this one, and neither does Kevin except that he said it was really good.

![saffron ice cream with graham crumbs](/food/foodventures/images/il-ridotto-saffron-ice-cream.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

We were pretty stuffed at this point, so it was a good thing there was just one last thing left on the menu: dessert.

This was hands-down the most amazing ice cream I had on this trip. And do you even know many cups of gelato we've eaten in the [past few days](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-north-italy-edition-emilia-romagna/)?

I've never had saffron ice cream before, and I couldn't really imagine what it would even taste like because all my experiences with saffron have been as part of a savoury dish. But saffron in sweet treats has to be seriously underrated, because this ice cream blew my mind. The graham cracker crumbs under the ice cream were delicious as well. They paired so well together. I could've done without the chocolate sauce, tbh, because the saffron flavour was so beautiful and rich on its own.

Without a doubt, dessert was my favourite course of the evening.

I also have to say something about the service of this restaurant. There was only one server for our table the entire evening, but she was very professional and prompt, and did a great job. The chef was also quite involved; he personally served a few of the dishes. Although very upscale, the atmosphere is a little cozier and more casual than at [Contraste](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-north-italy-edition-milan/#dinner-at-contraste), and I liked that.

## Tuesday

### Lunch at La Zucca

We stumbled into this tiny restaurant on a whim, not having done much research beforehand, but La Zucca turned out to be a stellar choice for a restaurant in the middle of touristy Venice proper.

![bread at la zucca](/food/foodventures/images/la-zucca-bread.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-left}

First: the bread. Kevin and I both liked the selection here: *tarallini* (the little o-shaped crackers that are a popular snack from southern Italy), thick *grissini* (light, airy breadsticks), and underneath, a floury Italian loaf. The crust on this bread was actually soft enough to eat without chewing my teeth off, so that's a bonus.

![pumpkin flan at la zucca](/food/foodventures/images/la-zucca-pumpkin-flan.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

Moving onto the mains: *zucca* means "squash" in Italian, so of course, I ordered their "pumpkin flan" entree. I wasn't sure what to expect, since I've only ever considered flan to be sweet. It turns out their "flan" is more a loaf of pumpkin puree, with the texture and consistency of pumpkin pie, topped with shredded smoked cheese and pumpkin seeds and a slightly tangy brine.

It actually tastes better than you'd expect from that description, although I wouldn't order it again, since the loaf was a tad bland. If you are really into pumpkin, though, I think you would like to try this twist on what we usually think of as a sweet vegetable.

![lamb with potatoes at la zucca](/food/foodventures/images/la-zucca-lamb.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-left} ![tiramisu at la zucca](/food/foodventures/images/la-zucca-tiramisu.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-left}

I didn't try Kevin's lamb entree with potato wedges, but boy did it smell inviting. According to him, it was one of his favourite dishes in Venice.

For dessert, he ordered their tiramisu (what a surprise). It paid off, because he said this was probably his favourite tiramisu out of all the ones he's eaten on this trip! The presentation is definitely on the simpler side, but I think that only adds to how rich and decadent it looks.

![raspberry semifreddo at la zucca](/food/foodventures/images/la-zucca-semifreddo.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

While Kevin chose tiramisu, I went for their raspberry semifreddo. (I honestly can't remember if it was raspberry or strawberry flavoured, but I'm leaning towards raspberry.) Although the tart flavour of the raspberry was wonderful, as was the little hint of fresh mint, it was not my favourite dessert. Since I love mousse and I love ice cream, I figured I would love what is basically a frozen mousse, but the texture was closer to shaved ice than the soft, creamy mouthfeel I was expecting.

The service was quite fast, so a great experience all around at this restaurant, and at â‚¬53.50, not too bad in terms of price (especially for a spot next to the Grand Canal).

### Gelato at Gelatoteca SuSo

![ice cream at gelatoteca suso](/food/foodventures/images/gelatoteca-suso.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

Dessert Round 2, anyone?! It was on the way back to Murano that I started getting a craving for gelato, especially since the day was really hot then. Gelatoteca SuSo was on the way back, and even though it was pretty crowded, the line moved quickly.

I got two flavours in a cone: the bottom scoop was watermelon. I wasn't a big fan of this one, it was too fruity and artificial for me, almost like a 7-Eleven Slurpee flavour? But the top scoop, Manet (chocolate and pistachio butter), omg, that's *my shit*. I could eat just that pistachio butter on its own all day, it was so creamy and nutty and sweet.

## Wednesday

### Lunch, Take 2 at Osteria al Duomo

Remember the restaurant where we were [massacred by mosquitoes](#lunch-at-osteria-al-duomo)? We decided to give them another try since neither of us had been in the right state of mind to enjoy our meal the last time around.

Sadly this time wasn't too great, either. I have to conclude that although the restaurant has a lengthy history, having been established in 1903 (that's earlier than Alberta became a province... omg), the food itself is average.

We made sure to shower in bug spray before we went, so mosquitoes weren't a problem. However, this time, there was a weird odour from near where we were sitting and it wasn't pleasant to smell right before a meal. Kevin's pizza was also served 5 minutes before my pasta, which is really weird and shouldn't
happen in a full service restaurant.

![tagliolini at osteria al duomo](/food/foodventures/images/osteria-al-duomo-tagliolini.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-left} ![tagliolini at osteria al duomo](/food/foodventures/images/osteria-al-duomo-tagliolini-1.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-left} ![tagliolini at osteria al duomo](/food/foodventures/images/osteria-al-duomo-amanda-pizza.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-left}

The entrees were ok, but nothing too special. I ordered the shrimp tagliolini with pistachio pesto. I liked the subtle flavours and the shrimp were substantial, but it wasn't salted enough, and I would've like more of the pistachio to come through.

Kevin ordered the "Amanda" pizza, essentially Hawaiian pizza. Obviously not the most authentic choice but it smelled and looked pretty appetizing, with a generous amount of toppings, too.

![tiramisu at osteria al duomo](/food/foodventures/images/osteria-al-duomo-tiramisu.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-left}

Dessert was, again, tiramisu, shared between the two of us. Not too much to say here, it was your standard tiramisu, really delicious and a big portion especially given the price (â‚¬5).

The bill on today's lunch came to â‚¬35 total.

## Thursday

For Thursday we decided to take a day trip to Burano, about a 20-minute boat ride from Venice proper, and holy shit if this isn't the prettiest little village ever. You can see some of the photos we took around the island in my ["Italy Trip" blog post](/food/foodventures/images/italy-trip-venice-bologna-milan), but for this post I will only be talking about the food.

### Dinner at Trattoria da Romano

![bread at trattoria da romano](/food/foodventures/images/trattoria-da-romano-bread.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-left}

You may think that such a small island wouldn't have a lot of food options, but there are actually several well-recognized establishments here.

The place we chose for dinner, Trattoria da Romano, has been praised by several celebrities, including Anthony Bourdain and Sylvester Stallone. That's why we were surprised when we ended up being the only ones eating in the restaurant for our entire meal. Obviously, though, those famous people knew what they were doing, because the food here was *mouthwatering*. This place has the softest bread we encountered yet in Italy, another bonus. I also loved the long, thin breadsticks.

![seafood risotto at trattoria da romano](/food/foodventures/images/trattoria-da-romano-risotto.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

We shared the *Risotto da Romano*, the restaurant's signature dish, made with goby fish. It blew both our minds. I have never tasted a flavour more suited to risotto! I was afraid Kevin would find it fishy, but he loved it too. Sadly, it was also super expensive, at â‚¬21 per person.

We weren't even completely full after licking our plates clean, so we ordered a platter of *scampi fritti* (fried shrimp) to share, clocking in at â‚¬30. Again, although delicious, the portions were small for the price.

![fried shrimp plate at trattoria da romano](/food/foodventures/images/trattoria-da-romano-scampi-fritti.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

The fried polenta here was made with white cornmeal rather than the yellow cornmeal at [Osteria al Duomo](#lunch-at-osteria-al-duomo). Both of them tasted pretty similar. However, it paired with the rest of the *scampi fritti* a lot better than it paired with [cuttlefish](#lunch-at-osteria-al-duomo).

Overall, together with one bottle of water (â‚¬4) and a cover charge of â‚¬3.50 per person, this ended up being our most expensive non-tasting menu dinner in Italy, at â‚¬83. Yes, it's pricy, no doubt to price-gouge tourists, but I have yet to find another place that serves such flavourful risotto, so I would still recommend a visit. Will totally change your expectations of what risotto can be.

## Friday

### Lunch at Rossopomodoro Pizzeria

If you want a decent, inexpensive lunch in the middle of St Mark's Square, this is it.

The service was friendly, but slow (and I don't mean that it was relaxed, in the typical Italian way, but rather that there didn't seem to be enough servers and we always had to wait for them to deal with two or three other issues before they got to us).

![fried neapolitan snacks at rossopomodoro pizzeria](/food/foodventures/images/rossopomodoro-tiellina.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

And the food was just ok. I wasn't too hungry, so we ordered a plate of fried Neapolitan snacks to share (*tiellina*). Those corndog-looking things are potato-stuffed croquettes (*crocchÃ¨ di patate*), and the smaller balls are fried dough with seaweed (*pasta cresciuta con alghe*). The croquettes are super duper filling. You may think that, at â‚¬12, it's not too big, but I strongly recommend sharing with at least one other person unless you're crazy hungry because it's quite a lot of food. I liked the fried dough balls as well, they were way chewier than I expected and had a mild herby flavour. I would like to try making them at home.

Kevin got a marinara pizza. It was really funny: I didn't take a picture, but picture a naked pizza, topped with only a thin layer of ~~tomato~~ marinara sauce and two whole cloves of roasted garlic in the centre. This guy loved it, though, so who am I to judge :-) I still can't get over how cheap pizza is in Italy, tbh. Kevin's pizza was only â‚¬7.50, and sure it didn't have a lot of toppings, but it was huge!

This was probably our cheapest meal in Venice, only â‚¬25.40 for everything.

## Saturday

### Lunch on Air Canada Rouge

![air canada rouge mid-flight meal](/food/foodventures/images/air-canada-meal-2.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-left}

Ironically, we got better meals on the trip back, flying with the budget carrier Rouge than on the [main Air Canada line](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-aug-12-16/#air-canada-flight-meal) that we flew in on.

The fruit plate I ordered was a lot more substantial this time around, and Kevin actually found his pasta meal palatable enough to finish. No picture of this, but we also got a hot savoury pie for the breakfast before landing!

Aaand that concludes everything we ate on vacation for the past two weeks (except for the snacksâ€”look for an Italian junk food post that I'm working on releasing soon). It's been amazing, Italy. *Arrivederci*!
