Lots of misses in the kitchen this week, but discovered a few bombshell successes too!!

## Monday:

![navy bean soup](/food/foodventures/images/navy-bean-soup.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

Actually, I made this on Friday, but with the exciting [Banh Mi Boys and birthday cakes](https://kellyzhang.me/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-attempting-meal-prep/) going around last weekend, I forgot to talk about this humble soup! This is a navy bean soup that's very warming and gives me chicken soup vibes, even though it's chicken-free (because I ran out of chicken stock...).

After my successful [lentil soup](/food/recipe/savoury-lentil-soup-slow-cooker-instant-pot/) recipe two weeks ago, I felt encouraged to make another slow cooker soup. They're so easy, so healthy *and* so tasty.

This recipe is from [Mom, What's For Dinner?](http://www.momwhatsfordinnerblog.com/2012/06/crock-pot-navy-bean-soup.html) and is another set-it-and-forget-it meal.

## Tuesday: Thin Mint Overnight Oats and Spinach Gnocchi

This is my second go with [Chocolate Covered Katie's Thin Mint Overnight Oats recipe](https://chocolatecoveredkatie.com/2017/02/23/thin-mint-cookie-overnight-oats/). The first time, I thought maybe I didn't add enough cocoa powder so it tasted kind of off. This time, I tried following the recipe exactly, except I swapped yogurt with cottage cheese. VERY DISAPPOINTING. It's very runny and doesn't taste like a thin mint at all. I'm going to throw my hat in for this one.

Spinach gnocchi: another disappointing recipe! I followed [a recipe from Caroline's Cooking](https://www.carolinescooking.com/potato-spinach-gnocchi/). No matter how much flour I added (over a cup more than what the recipe called for), the mixture was still relentlessly sticky and too difficult to handle. I tried to shape them as best I could, but it was so time consuming that I ended up throwing a third of it out. This is coming from someone who hates wasting food.

Also, I added literally the tiniest pinch of nutmeg, as per recipe, and that ended up making the whole thing taste so strange. I couldn't get rid of the pumpkin spice smell profile that the nutmeg evoked and it was honestly too disgusting.

![vegetable stock](/food/foodventures/images/vegetable-stock.jpg){:width="35%"}{: .image-left}

While recovering from the spinach gnocchi catastrophe, I did pull off one successful maneuver tonight, which was making another batch of vegetable stock. I have to say, I'm pretty good at this now. My freezer generally always has one full bag of veggie scraps, which I throw in the Instant Pot with eight cups of water and pressure cook @ HIGH for 30 minutes. Then I either quick release immediately, or wait ten minutes. (Depends on how I'm feeling; doesn't make a noticeable difference, imo).

I pour it through a strainer into a freezer bag (if I'm freezing) or a mason jar (if I plan to use it soon) and then I always have vegetable stock ready to go whenever I need it!

## Wednesday: Tofu Avocado Mousse, Tofu Grilled Cheese, and Peanut Butter Oats

![tofu avocado mousse](/food/foodventures/images/tofu-avocado-mousse.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

Tonight is a tofu kinda night!! First we have a chocolate tofu avocado mousse. Almost all dessert tofu recipes call for silken tofu, but I used regular fresh tofu. It worked really well. This recipe comes from [Plant-Based Cooking](https://www.plantbasedcooking.com/recipe/tasty-tofu-avocado-chocolate-mousse/), and I can't recommend it enough. I made the recipe the night before and brought it in for work. I was afraid the avocado's taste might change from being oxidized overnight, but I couldn't tell at all. A refreshing change from my overnight oats routine.

![tofu grilled cheese](/food/foodventures/images/tofu-grilled-cheese.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

After work, I whipped up a quick tofu "grilled cheese" in my waffle maker, roughly following a recipe from [Aloha Tofu](http://aloha-tofu.com/tofu-recipes/tofu-firm/grilled-cheese-sandwich/). Folks, I've got an announcement to make. Tofu does *not* taste good in everything. I love tofu and I love grilled cheese, but I think they go better separately.

I can't describe what I find so off putting about this flavour combo, but there's a reason you don't see many *cheesy tofu* dishes. I prefer the pure "soy" taste of the tofu to remain unadulterated by the overpowering cheese.
