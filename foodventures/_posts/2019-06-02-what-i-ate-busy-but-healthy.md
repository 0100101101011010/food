## Monday: Apple Butter on Smearcase and Fried Rice with Chickpeas

![apple butter on cottage cheese](/food/foodventures/images/apple-butter-cottage-cheese.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

For lunch, I only had an hour between class and tutorial today, so I dolloped two big spoonfuls of my homemade apple butter ([recipe from Pressure Cook Recipes](https://www.pressurecookrecipes.com/instant-pot-apple-butter/)) (90 g) on a bowl of 1% cottage cheese (180 g). It looks like genuine shit, but tastes pretty amazing for something that requires no preparation whatsoever. Ordinarily, I'm not huge on the taste or texture of cottage cheese, but this worked for me!

Believe it or not, I'm not the creator of this recipe. Apparently it's quite popular among older generations of the Pennsylvania Dutch, and is traditionally known as [ludwarrich on smearcase](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/16520/smearcase). I feel like the traditional method doesn't intend for anyone to use $2.99 processed cottage cheese from No Frills, but that's what I had on hand!

I had a small break between my morning and afternoon classes, so I came back to prep a batch of rice for dinner. Unfortunately, since I was making so much rice, it didn't come to pressure in time and I had to leave again before it was ready. I told Kevin to release the pressure for me, but he's never used the Instant Pot before and it took him a while to figure out, so the rice ended up cooking for an extra 10 minutes before he managed to release the pressure. Since I've learned from experience that the quality of rice is so time-sensitive, I was afraid the rice would turn out mushy and overcooked.

When I came home later to inspect it, it *was* clumpier and softer than usual, and the fried rice I made with it for dinner was a bit too sticky. (I reduced the amount of rice I usually use and made up the volume with chickpeas, since I was afraid the mushiness would be too unappetizing. But it wasn't too bad. I ended up having to pick the chickpeas out later anyways because Kevin didn't like the texture, lol.)

It could have ended up a lot worse! Hopefully, after a day or two in the fridge, it'll return to having that well-defined separate grains texture we love in fried rice.

## Tuesday: Omurice (my first time!) and Chickpea Curry

My first class today was at 11:30, so I took my time making breakfast for Kevin today. I decided to try making omurice for the very first time. I was kind of intimidated, but after watching two YouTube videos, I thought, "this doesn't look too hard!" It turned out so well, I impressed myself.

![first time making omurice](/food/foodventures/images/omurice-1.jpg){:width="48%"}{: .image-left}

First, I added one finely diced onion along with a drop of vegetable oil to a non-stick pan on medium-high. A few minutes later, I added half a can of roughly chopped spam (in "MaLa Spicy Szechuan" flavour. It's so good!) and sauteed until the spam began to brown. I then added some of the rice I made from yesterday. I've cooked fried rice so many times now I don't even bother with measurements, I just eyeball everything.

After roughly breaking up the rice clumps, I added a pinch of soy sauce and kept adding ketchup until it achieved the colour I wanted, maybe 3–4 tbsp. When the rice had fully separated and everything was a nice even colour, I transferred it from the pan into a bowl. In the pan I now added two eggs + 50 mL of aquafaba, or essentially three eggs, and quickly spread it into a thin layer to make like an egg crepe. In retrospect this was way more egg than necessary; next time I would use that same amount of egg but for two crepes. I also turned the heat down to medium-low at this point.

![ta-da! assembled omurice!](/food/foodventures/images/omurice-6.jpg){:width="48%"}{: .image-left}

As the egg was coming together, I used about half the fried rice mixture and shaped it into an oblong shape on a plate. Kinda like a football lol! Once the egg was done (it doesn't take long to cook), I draped it over top of the rice. This is where I failed a little bit, since the crepe was bigger than it should've been. I tried tucking the bottoms in a little bit, but it was quite fragile so it started tearing, so I thought fuck it and just let it droop over the whole thing like a blanket.

Kevin said this was his favourite fried rice so far, and he really liked the egg-over-rice concept, so even though it was ugly, it sure was tasty!

![walk-away chickpea, tomato, and spinach curry](/food/foodventures/images/chickpea-tomato-spinach-curry.jpg){:width="70%"}{: .image-left}

For myself, I repeated the apple butter/cottage cheese combo from yesterday for breakfast. After grocery shopping, I made a late lunch with a bunch of leftovers in the fridge—spinach, half-used jars of crushed tomatoes and coconut milk, and boiled chickpeas.

This [walk-away curry](https://mygoodnesskitchen.com/wprm_print/9640) was perfectly delicious, even though I substituted the crushed tomatoes for grape tomatoes and tomato paste, and used only half a jar of coconut milk since that's all I had left. I also made it in the slow cooker by leaving it on high for two hours. I filled a huge container with it, so I have back-up meals for the rest of the week now!

![soybean puree](/food/foodventures/images/soybean-puree.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

Oh, and here's a little bonus thing I made: Since I've been falling over myself looking for soy recipes ever since I ordered 25 lbs of raw soybeans, I decided to just blend up a cup of soaked soybeans and pressure cook them, to see what they ended up like. It ended up with a soufflé effect in the pressure cooker, which I was so not expecting!! Once I let it cool down and stirred it, it went back down, but I thought it was cool how it could rise so much. I'm not really sure what I'm going to do with it, at this point. Maybe add it to some brownies recipe? Pancakes? The consistency is like okara, but thinner. I was thinking of eating it like yogurt, with some oats and berries, but it might be too gritty. Oh well, I'll figure it out! It's been so fun experimenting with different ways to use soybeans. I am seriously mad for soy in almost any form, and I'm so excited to be able to play around with it.

## Wednesday: Chocolate Cream Pie

![chocolate cream pie](/food/foodventures/images/chocolate-cream-pie.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

I was in a huge rush getting ready this morning, so I only had time to eat an egg for breakfast (it sounds so sad, a single egg). By 11 o'clock, I was super hungry, so I stopped by the [café at DP](https://uwaterloo.ca/food-services/content/browsers-cafe) and bought what I thought was a donut, but turns out it's called a cream pie. In my experience with pastries from that café, as long as it's not stale and the icing isn't hard, it's good. This was definitely satisfying enough for me and my starving tummy.

For dinner, I had another serving of the [red beans and rice](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-semi-meal-prepping) I made last week. At this point, I'm honestly just trying to get rid of it. I've accepted that it just doesn't taste that great, but at least it's filling and healthy.

## Thursday: Mock "McGriddles" and Nuri Village

Kevin was really hungry last night, since all he had to eat was the leftovers from making omurice, so I told him I'd make him a hearty breakfast this morning to make up for it. During the night, I came up with the genius idea of using PANCAKES instead of english muffins to make a breakfast sandwich!

After like 2 minutes on Google I found out McDonalds beat me to this idea :-/

Anyway, I still had a hack at it, and it turns out to be really easy. I mean, it is essentially frying up pancakes, eggs, and bacon and stacking them together. The hardest part was making the pancake batter! I wanted to use the soybean pulp I made on Tuesday

## Friday: "Freezer Cleanout"

For breakfast I had the "old faithful" recipe of the week, aka apple butter on cottage cheese, and then it was off to class, with a sliced bell pepper and quarter cup of roasted chickpeas in my bag.

I ordered a shelving unit on wheels this week from [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2HMZqCW) to deal with the space issues in my kitchen, and I can't wait to use it!
