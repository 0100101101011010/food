## Monday:

![apple butter on cottage cheese](apple-butter-cottage-cheese.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

For lunch, I only had an hour between class and tutorial today, so I dolloped two big spoonfuls of my [homemade apple butter](#) (90 g) on a bowl of 1% cottage cheese (180 g). It looks like genuine shit, but tastes pretty amazing for something that requires no preparation whatsoever. I'm not huge on the taste or texture of cottage cheese, but this worked for me!

Believe it or not, I'm not the creator of this recipe. Apparently it's quite popular among the Pennsylvania Dutch

## Tuesday:

For myself, I repeated the apple butter/cottage cheese combo from yesterday for breakfast. After grocery shopping, I made a late lunch with a bunch of leftovers in the fridge—spinach, half-used jars of tomatoes and coconut milk, and boiled chickpeas. This [walk-away curry](https://mygoodnesskitchen.com/wprm_print/9640) was perfectly delicious, even though I made a bunch of substitutions!
