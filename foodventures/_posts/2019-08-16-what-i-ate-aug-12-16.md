excerpt: "It's another short post this week as I'm heading off to Italy on Friday. This week has been less than healthy because I've been a bit preoccupied with exams, and I've had no motivation to cook."

### Canadian War Cake

The name of this cake sounds a bit aggressive, but it's a fitting descriptor because this was a cake made during WWII, when food supplies in Canada were rationed. The batter uses no butter or eggs and as a result it's a super economical recipe that uses what you can always expect to have on hand.

It's not an exclusively Canadian recipe either, because Googling it turns up results for similar cakes made throughout North America using a boiled syrup mixture of sugar and raisins mixed with flour. Variations of this cake go by names like "depression cake" and "boiled cake." Absolutely 0 of these names sound appetizing, but I really wanted to give it a try because 1) it's Canadian!! and 2) how good can a cake with so few ingredients taste?

To make the batter, you first boil the sugar, raisins, and shortening together to make a sort of runny syrup. After letting it cool for a few minutes, you stir in flour and baking soda. It looks awful, doesn't it? Be careful not

From this brown and lumpy batter, you can actually make a pretty nice cake. It's not fancy by any means, with nothing in the way of decoration like an icing or glaze or some powdered sugar on top. But the cakes I make for personal consumption don't usually have those either (I find the cake sponge itself tasty enough without that extra sugar).

The texture is a little bit gluey (is this what Paul Hollywood means when he says something is "claggy?") but it's pretty enjoyable!

### Poutine from Chef On Call

OMG, look at this plate of carby goodness!

## Thursday

### Apple Turnovers

This was literally baked at the last minute before I had to go write my Chemistry exam. Nothing to take your mind off your impending doom than to do some baking! I had a tube of Pillsbury Crescent Roll Dough in the fridge that I wanted to use up before it expired.

It's my first time using this stuff, and hmm, it's saltier than I expected? It wasn't too much of a problem because I used Empire apples, which are very sweet.

Basically, I smeared some apple pie spice (2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cardamom, ur welcome) on each of the eight pieces of triangular dough. Then I placed a quarter of an apple at the larger end of the triangle and rolled it up, like an overweight croissant. I didn't find it necessary to add any sugar because of the sweetness of the apples, but feel free to do so.

I baked at 350 °F until the top looked golden brown, which took about 15 minutes.

After all was said and done, I found the pre-made crescent roll dough... underwhelming. I don't make pastry much to begin with, so I think for the future I'd rather just take the time to make my own dough from scratch. I'm excited to start experimenting with some vegan pastries.

## Friday
