### Coconut Chocolate Chip Blondies

![coconut chocolate chip blondies](/food/foodventures/images/vegan-brownies-toasted-coconut.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right}

Since Kevin thought the brownies I made last week were too chocolatey and rich, we thought he would probably like blondies better than brownies. He did like the toasted coconut from the brownies, though, so I set out to find a recipe for coconut blondies.

The recipe [one I settled on](https://theconscientiouseater.com/vegan-coconut-chocolate-chunk-blondies/) calls for 1 cup of sugar (200 g), but I only used 75 g and it was plenty sweet enough. I love sweets, but I can't understand how someone

## Wednesday

### Laughing Cow and Honey on Toast

![vegan brownies](/food/foodventures/images/vegan-brownies-toasted-coconut.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right}

This is the [second time]() I've made this combination, and although I'd much prefer an actual jam or spread, I kind of enjoy the taste of honey and mild cheese together.

I didn't look too closely the last time I'd eaten it, but this time, I took a pretty clear picture, and as you can see... the cheese kind of... split. It looked gross, but I ate it anyway. I did some Googling afterwards and found out that the pH of honey is 3.9 on average!! That's so acidic (even more so than fresh tomatoes)! No wonder the cheese reacted badly.

### Canadian War Cake

![canadian war cake](/food/foodventures/images/canadian-war-cake-1.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

The name of the cake sounds a bit aggressive, but it's a fitting descriptor when you learn [this was a cake created during WWII](https://youtu.be/6o_1JqqfoZo). Food supplies in Canada were rationed at the time, and home cooks had to find creative ways to stretch their ingredients while still making something tasty. This batter uses no butter or eggs, and as a result, it's a super economical recipe.

![canadian war cake](/food/foodventures/images/canadian-war-cake-2.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

It's not an exclusively Canadian recipe either, because Googling it turns up results for similar cakes made throughout North America using a boiled syrup mixture of sugar and raisins mixed with flour. Variations of this cake go by names like "depression cake" and "boiled cake." Absolutely zero of these names sound appetizing, but I really wanted to give this particular recipe a try because 1) it's Canadian!! and 2) I was curious if it would actually taste good even from a modern perspective, for someone like me who has never lacked for food.

To make the batter, you first boil the sugar, raisins, and shortening together to make a sort of runny syrup. After letting it cool for a few minutes, you stir in flour and baking soda. It looks awful, doesn't it?

From this brown and lumpy batter, you can actually make a pretty nice cake. It's not fancy by any means, with nothing in the way of decoration like an icing or glaze or some powdered sugar on top. But the cakes I make for personal consumption don't usually have those either (I find the cake sponge itself tasty enough without that extra sugar).

The texture is a little bit gluey (is this what Paul Hollywood means when he says something is "claggy?") but it's pretty enjoyable! I don't like the raisins, but I know there are depression cakes with chocolate flavours, so I might try that variation next time.

### Poutine from Chef On Call

OMG, look at this plate of carby goodness!

![large poutine from chef on call turnovers](/food/foodventures/images/chef-on-call-poutine.gif){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

I don't know if you've noticed but I've been kind of sleeping on healthy meals this week because of a lack of motivation. (WE'RE GOING TO ITALY IN TWO DAYS!! I don't know how anyone can stay motivated to carry on daily life tasks in the face of that news.)

We haven't had poutine in such a long time, so I acquiesced when Kevin suggested getting delivery from Chef on Call. This is a fairly new restaurant in our area. We had tried a sample of their food not long ago and liked it, so we wanted to give it a try. This is the first restaurant I've seen that gives the option for the poutine to be made with *CURLY FRIES!!!* I know that there's no difference between regular fries and curly fries except for the shape, but curly fries are just so much more fun to eat, so even though it was an extra $1 charge to make the change, we went for it.

The food is on the expensive side, clocking in at $11 for a large poutine (with regular fries), but it was very delicious. Our only complaint is the gravy could have been thicker. There was also too much cheese for Kevin's taste, but one upside of living with me is never having to worry about anything having too much cheese—ya girl will take care of it for you.

### Apple Turnovers

This was literally baked at the last minute before I had to go write my Chemistry exam. Nothing to take your mind off your impending doom than to do some baking! I had a tube of Pillsbury Crescent Roll Dough in the fridge that I wanted to use up before it expired.

It's my first time using this stuff, and hmm, it's saltier than I expected? It wasn't too much of a problem because I used Empire apples, which are very sweet.

![apple turnovers](/food/foodventures/images/apple-turnovers.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

It's very loosely based off of a [recipe from the Pillsbury website](https://www.pillsbury.com/recipes/apple-pie-crescents/bebb6148-6e4a-441d-9212-f435d974dcc6), but basically, I smeared some apple pie spice (2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cardamom, ur welcome) on each of the eight pieces of triangular dough. Then I placed a quarter of an apple at the larger end of the triangle and rolled it up, like an overweight croissant. I didn't find it necessary to add any sugar because of the sweetness of the apples, but feel free to do so.

I baked at 350 °F until the top looked golden brown, which took about 15 minutes.

After all was said and done, I found the pre-made crescent roll dough... underwhelming. I don't make pastry much to begin with, so I think for the future I'd rather just take the time to make my own dough from scratch. I'm excited to start experimenting with some vegan pastries.

## Friday

### Shrimp, Scallop and Salmon Brochettes from Lee Kitchen

![seafood brochettes from lee kitchen (pearson airport)](/food/foodventures/images/canadian-war-cake-3.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

First impressions weren't great, but then you have to lower the bar a certain level for airport food. The utensils weren't fully clean and my seat didn't have a fork or knife, only a pair of chopsticks.

Kevin ordered the fried rice dish to be safe while I went with seafood brochettes (no idea what brochettes were at the time of ordering but they sounded fancy).

The original plan was to share both plates, but once the brochettes arrived (and it turns out they are basically a French term for kebabs, at least in this restaurant's interpretation), Kevin for whatever reason no longer had interest in the dish and told me to take it all.

The brochettes were glazed in a nice generic slightly-sweet sauce and grilled, along with some slices of red onion and red pepper. It was served with some baby bok choy and a tomato-pea pilaf. I thought everything was quite delicious. Kevin fared worse with his fried rice dish, which he said was "inedible" and "disgusting."

### Air Canada Flight Meal
