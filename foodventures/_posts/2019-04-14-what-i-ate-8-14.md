## Friday: NO-KNEAD BREAD THAT WORKS!!

Holy shit I am SO excited about this.

Unfortunately I didn't take much pictures throughout this whole process, but I'm sure I'll be baking this bread again in the future so stay tuned for updated photos!

I took a shower, prepared the dough, which took less than five minutes, including gathering the ingredients, and left for work. I actually ended up getting off work earlier than expected (YAY) so I had to wait another couple of hours for the proofing process to reach the 12-hour mark. Meanwhile, I baked a pan of matcha mochis—more on that below.

I took off the lid after 25 minutes, and the dough was mostly set in the round bread shape by then, although the top was pasty white and still had a wet sheen. At 40 minutes (15 with the lid off), the top was a beautiful golden colour, but Lahey says the crust should look a darker brown, so I gave it another 10 minutes. Such a long impatient wait!! In fact, I'm typing this right now as I'm waiting in the final stretch.

... And there we go.
