### Osteria di Brera

I have to say, the most culture-shock part of this lunch came from the bread situation.

![risotto with shrimp and mollusc](/food/foodventures/images/risotto-shrimp-mollusc.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-left}

Kevin got the risotto with shrimp and mollusc, since risotto is one of Milan's specialties. He liked the rice and shrimp but found the molluscs too briny. I thought the flavour was okay, but tbh, I've never really cared for risotto. The rice is kind of hard and chalky to me, and even though I like dairy-rich dishes like Alfredo, I don't enjoy the taste of milk in risotto.

I ordered a raw seafood platter, or *mix di crudo,* which cost about €35 (or roughly $50 CAD). There was SO MUCH FOOD. This is the only instance I can remember where I didn't finish a dish of raw fish, just because I was so stuffed.

[\*EDIT: It's now two days later, and I haven't suffered any gastrointestinal issues at all. I have some concerns of food poisoning or indigestion every time I eat so much raw seafood, but in this case the food turns out to be perfectly fine.]

The only issue (aside from the bread that we didn't know how to eat) was the frankly terrible service. There was a single waiter and a busboy, so I would understand the slow service if it was during peak hours, but we came at a very slow time with not too many other patrons, and still it took ages just for us to get our water.

I love the European custom of non-tipping. Instead, restaurants here charge a flat-rate *coperto* (cover charge) based on the number of people in your party, usually €2–3 per person. I like this system a LOT more, because it always feels awkward for me to decide the percentage tip a server deserves, and it's annoying when you get a bad server but still need to tip because it's the norm.

### Cantina della Vetra

We visited the Colonne di San Lorenzo and Basilica San Lorenzo Maggiore this afternoon and decided to find somewhere to eat nearby. The Cantina della Vetra was our closest restaurant, according to Google Maps, and it had good ratings, so we gave it a try.

We left with a very good impression. The menu at Cantina is fairly short, which makes ordering easy. It's also very detailed, with an extensive allergens list for each dish from gluten to celery, and a star beside the menu items in which some ingredients may be sourced from frozen (I only saw two dishes carrying this designation).

We shared a small bowl of potato chips (which were thin, crispy, and delicious), and a basket of complimentary bread (which were thick, tough, and hurt my teeth).

Kevin ordered the *risotto alla milanese* as per my suggestion.

I still don't like risotto, but this is my favourite risotto I've tasted so far. The flavours of the saffron and milk are very intense. When it first hit my mouth, I was like, "nah, not feeling this," but as I chewed, I began to enjoy it more and more! I went back for several more bites, and it actually seemed to get better with each mouthful.

I ordered a dish of whole wheat maltagliati (a wide, flat pasta) with pesto, pine nuts, and some other vegetables. It came in a teeny tiny serving, which was unexpected but good, because we have a reservation to Contraste, the Michelin 1-star restaurant, later this evening, and I didn't want to still be stuffed by the time dinner rolled around.

The flavour is most similar to the cookie part of an Oreo, but the texture is more crumbly.

Again, the water here was very nice, but it was more expensive at €3 per bottle. Kevin and I are speculating that Milanese don't drink the water from the tap and just buy bottled or filtered water, because the water at restaurants here is so much better than the water at our Airbnb (whereas in North America, all the water comes straight from the tap).
