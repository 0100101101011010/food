excerpt: "This week's regular post is getting cut short, because I'll be traveling to Montreal on Thursday for this year's F1 Grand Prix (and for a taste of authentic Montreal poutine, and smoked meat, and bagels, and... you get it). (Check out my [special edition post](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-montreal-edition/) all about the best Montreal eats.)"
