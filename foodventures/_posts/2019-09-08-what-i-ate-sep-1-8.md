## Monday


### Coconut Chocolate Chip Blondies

![coconut chocolate chip blondies](/food/foodventures/images/vegan-brownies-toasted-coconut.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right}

Since Kevin thought the [brownies](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-aug-5-11/#vegan-brownies-with-toasted-coconut) I made last week were too chocolatey and rich, I thought he would probably like blondies better than brownies. He did like the toasted coconut from the brownies, though, so I set out to find a recipe for coconut blondies.

The recipe [one I settled on](https://theconscientiouseater.com/vegan-coconut-chocolate-chunk-blondies/) calls for 1 cup of sugar (200 g), but I only used 75 g and it was plenty. I love sweets, but I can't understand how someone could eat something that sweet!!


## Wednesday

### Laughing Cow and Honey on Toast

![vegan brownies](/food/foodventures/images/laughing-cow-honey-toast.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right}

This is the [second time]() I've made this combination, and although I'd much prefer an actual jam or spread, I kind of enjoy the taste of honey and mild cheese together.

I didn't look too closely the last time I'd eaten it, but this time, I took a pretty clear picture, and as you can see... the cheese kind of... split. It looked gross, but I ate it anyway. I did some Googling afterwards and found out that the pH of honey is 3.9 on average!! That's so acidic (even more so than fresh tomatoes)! No wonder the cheese reacted badly.

### Canadian War Cake

![canadian war cake](/food/foodventures/images/canadian-war-cake-1.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right} ![canadian war cake](/food/foodventures/images/canadian-war-cake-2.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right}

The name of the cake sounds a bit aggressive, but it's a fitting descriptor when you learn [this was a cake created during WWII](https://youtu.be/6o_1JqqfoZo). Food supplies in Canada were rationed at the time, and home cooks had to find creative ways to stretch their ingredients while still making something tasty. This batter uses no butter or eggs, and as a result, it's a super economical recipe.



It's not an exclusively Canadian recipe either, because Googling it turns up results for similar cakes made throughout North America using a boiled syrup mixture of sugar and raisins mixed with flour. Variations of this cake go by names like "depression cake" and "boiled cake." Absolutely zero of these names sound appetizing, but I really wanted to give this particular recipe a try because 1) it's Canadian!! and 2) I was curious if it would actually taste good even from a modern perspective, for someone like me who has never lacked for food.

To make the batter, you first boil the sugar, raisins, and shortening together to make a sort of runny syrup. After letting it cool for a few minutes, you stir in flour and baking soda. It looks awful, doesn't it?



From this brown and lumpy batter, you can actually make a pretty nice cake. It's not fancy by any means, with nothing in the way of decoration like an icing or glaze or some powdered sugar on top. But the cakes I make for personal consumption don't usually have those either (I find the cake sponge itself tasty enough without that extra sugar).

The texture is a little bit gluey (is this what Paul Hollywood means when he says something is "claggy?") but it's pretty enjoyable! I don't like the raisins, but I know there are depression cakes with chocolate flavours, so I might try that variation next time.

### Poutine from Chef On Call

OMG, look at this plate of carby goodness!

![large poutine from chef on call turnovers](/food/foodventures/images/chef-on-call-poutine.gif){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

I don't know if you've noticed but I've been kind of sleeping on healthy meals this week because of a lack of motivation. (WE'RE GOING TO ITALY IN TWO DAYS!! I don't know how anyone can stay motivated to carry on daily life tasks in the face of that news.)

We haven't had poutine [in over a month](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jul-1-7/#poutine-with-st-albert-cheese-curds), so I acquiesced when Kevin suggested getting delivery from Chef on Call and sharing a poutine. This is a fairly new restaurant in our area. We had tried a sample of their food not long ago and liked it, so we wanted to give it a try. This is the first restaurant I've seen that gives the option for the poutine to be made with *CURLY FRIES!!!* I know that there's no difference between regular fries and curly fries except for the shape, but curly fries are just so much more fun to eat, so even though it was an extra $1 charge to make the change, we went for it.

The food is on the expensive side, clocking in at $11.50 for the "O.G. Large" poutine (with regular fries), but it was very delicious. Our only complaint is the gravy could have been thicker. There was also too much cheese for Kevin's taste, but one upside of living with me is never having to worry about anything having too much cheese—ya girl will take care of it for you.

## Thursday

### Roasted Cauliflower Rice with Garlic and Lemon

So I learned something ~~disturbing~~ interesting today... apparently cauliflower takes a hella long time to go bad. I had a head of cauliflower sitting in the fridge when we left for [Italy](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-north-italy-edition-milan), and when I opened the fridge again today, fully expecting it to be brown and soggy, it was still in pretty good shape.

I made some roasted cauliflower rice with it according to [Skinnytaste's recipe](https://www.skinnytaste.com/roasted-cauliflower-rice-with-garlic-and-lemon/) and no exaggeration, this is the best cauli rice I've had yet.

## Friday

### Sushi

Sadly it's not fully vegan yet, because I used a spicy Japanese mayo

### Sunday



As usual, I'm not so impressed with [this curry](https://www.greensnchocolate.com/red-lentil-coconut-curry-stuffed-spaghetti-squash/) (followed recipe except for spinach, since I didn't have any on hand). I've eaten plenty of lentil curries in restaurants, so I know it's something I enjoy, but I can never quite replicate it at home.
