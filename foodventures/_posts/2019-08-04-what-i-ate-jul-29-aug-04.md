### Spam & Salami Pizza

![spam & salami pizza](/food/foodventures/images/spam-salami-pizza.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right}

Mediocre pizza for dinner tonight.

I think this is the first time Kevin has ever complained about too much garlic on a dish. I do think I overdid it this time; I should've rolled it into the dough rather than spreading it on top. The other reason this pizza wasn't the best: I had run out of tomato sauce, so I used ketchup instead. Ketchup works for a lot of things, but turns out pizza isn't one of them. It was too sweet and didn't pair well with the salami and spam.

## Tuesday

### Bok Choy and Spam Fried Rice

![bok choy and spam fried rice](/food/foodventures/images/bok-choy-spam-fried-rice.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}

I think this combo of baby bok choy and spam is a winner, but this time the rice wasn't right.

Generally, each time I make rice, it's a big batch at once that we reheat for the rest of the week (your girl hates scrubbing rice off the bottom of the cooking pot). Last week, I made some basmati rice to go with a [veggie egg hash](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jul-22-28/#veggie-egg-hash), so that's what I used tonight. Note to self: *Basmati rice does not work in fried rice!* The grains had no stickiness and didn't have the nice chew that you expect from a good fried rice dish.

I also should've added more soy sauce. It was hardly salty at all, which was disappointing since the flavour otherwise was great. I will definitely be making this again, but need to do more tasting next time to get the seasoning right.

### Roast Chicken with Cauliflower and Potatoes Lyonnaise

![roast chicken, cauliflower, potatoes lyonnaise](/food/foodventures/images/roast-chicken-1.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}

I gave a go at roasting a whole chicken today! Tbh, I've been intimidated by whole chickens for a long time now, but I figure it's one of those skills that you have to learn sooner or later, so I followed a simple looking recipe from [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/chicken-roasted-cauliflower) and crossed my fingers.

Turns out roasting and carving chickens is so much easier than I'd expected. Really, the hardest part is pushing the oil and seasonings under the skin, and the rest is basically putting it into the oven and waiting.

Dinner tonight was a total success! Kevin was a huge fan of the cauliflower (I've never seen him this happy over vegetables before) and although the chicken was a bit dry, he still scarfed down a whole thigh. Surprisingly, the worst part of the meal was actually the potatoes, which I only prepared because I was afraid Kevin would protest the lack of carbs—they were over-salted, I think.

## Wednesday

### Chinese Steamed Buns (Mantou)

![mini mantou in the instant pot](/food/foodventures/images/mantou-1.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-left}

Yes, you can make these bbs in the Instant Pot!!

*Mantou* were a huge part of my breakfasts growing up, but my mom liked to use whole wheat flour, which is a no for me, so I never particularly liked them. (I love whole wheat flour in so many things, but in something as pure as mantou where there are no competing flavours or textures in the dough, the whole wheat is too much.) However, I've always loved the ones served at restaurants, you know, the ones that were fried to golden perfection and dipped in some condensed milk?

![mini mantou dipped in condensed milk](/food/foodventures/images/mantou-2.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}

When I moved out, I realized I could make my own cute, white flour only mantou. And since I don't have a double steamer like my parents do at home, the Instant Pot was a perfect substitute!

I'll be posting a recipe soon, but they were so easy to make. In my experience, steaming in the Instant Pot takes about 1/4 the time it takes on the stove, so I set the Instant Pot on STEAM (high pressure) for 5 min before quick releasing. I made mini mantou, which meant I could steam eight at a time, but if you make them twice the size of these ones and cook four at a time, I would add 1–2 min to the steam time. I'll be experimenting with bigger buns to verify this before I publish the recipe.

### Ube Jam

![ube jam](/food/foodventures/images/ube-jam.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

Purple yam jam, or ube halaya, is a Filipino dessert that can be eaten on its own or as, well, a jam or spread. The [recipe I used](https://panlasangpinoy.com/ube-halaya-with-cheese-recipe/) calls for grated cheese on top, but after tasting it I decided it was already plenty rich on its own without adding cheese.

I intended to cook this to eat on its own, but it was way too cloying and sweet for me to take many bites, so the rest of it is probably going to go into an ensaymada recipe in the next few days. This is quite a tedious recipe to make, tbh, because you need to boil all the water off which takes *forever.* And you can't turn away from the stove either, because the mixture of coconut milk and condensed milk can very very quickly boil over.

Conclusion: will not be making this again, but am very glad I did because I absolutely love all things ube, and it was gonna bother me forever that I hadn't tried it. 

### Ong Choy in XO Sauce

![ong choy in xo sauce](/food/foodventures/images/ong-choy-xo-sauce.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

Well I am super happy to rediscover another old favourite veggie at T&T that I could never find in western supermarkets. First [snow pea leaves](#), now ong choy, otherwise known as water spinach!

I didn't want to eat too much for dinner after such a calorific day, so I cooked it following a super simple recipe: [pan frying ong choy in XO sauce](https://thewoksoflife.com/ong-choy-xo-sauce/). It was sooo tasty, and such a quick, easy meal. I want to buy more of this vegetable and try different sauces to go with it!
