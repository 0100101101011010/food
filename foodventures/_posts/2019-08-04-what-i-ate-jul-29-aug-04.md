### Spam & Salami Pizza

Mediocre pizza for dinner tonight.

I think this is the first time Kevin has ever complained about too much garlic on a dish. I do think I overdid it this time; I should've rolled it into the dough rather than spreading it on top. The other reason this pizza wasn't the best: I had run out of tomato sauce, so I used ketchup instead. Ketchup works for a lot of things, but turns out pizza isn't one of them. It was too sweet and didn't pair well with the salami and spam.

## Tuesday

### Bok Choy and Spam Fried Rice

I think this combo of baby bok choy and spam is a winner, but the rice wasn't right.

Generally, each time I make rice, it's a big batch at once that we reheat for the rest of the week (your girl hates scrubbing rice off the bottom of the cooking pot). Last week, I made some basmati rice to go with a [veggie egg hash](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jul-22-28/#veggie-egg-hash), so that's what I used tonight. Note to self: *Basmati rice does not work in fried rice!* The grains had no stickiness and didn't have the nice chew that you expect from a good fried rice dish.

I also should've added more soy sauce. It was hardly salty at all, which was disappointing since the flavour otherwise was great. I will definitely be making this again, but need to do more tasting next time to get the seasoning right.

### Roast Chicken with Cauliflower and Potatoes Lyonnaise

I gave a go at roasting a whole chicken today! Tbh, I've been intimidated by whole chickens for a long time now, but I figure it's one of those skills that you have to learn sooner or later, so I followed a simple looking recipe from [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/chicken-roasted-cauliflower) and crossed my fingers.

Turns out roasting and carving chickens is so much easier than I'd expected. Really, the hardest part is pushing the oil and seasonings under the skin, and the rest is basically putting it into the oven and waiting.

Dinner tonight was a total success! Kevin was a huge fan of the cauliflower (I've never seen him this happy over vegetables before) and although the chicken was a bit dry, he still scarfed down a whole thigh. Surprisingly, the worst part of the meal was actually the potatoes, which I only prepared because I was afraid Kevin would protest the lack of carbs—they were over-salted, I think.
