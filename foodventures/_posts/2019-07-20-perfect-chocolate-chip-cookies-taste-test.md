So this is my first "test kitchen" recipe, where I make the same recipe a bunch of times, each with slight variations, to find the *Goldilocks* batch of chocolate chip cookies.

For this experiment, I used a recipe provided by [/u/sewamyruth](https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/cf7r7o/turn_grandmas_old_recipe_into_a_tea_towel/eu8czuj/), passed down from their grandma. The original recipe is as follows:

## Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe

### Ingredients

* 2 cups shortening (I used Crisco)
* 2 cups brown sugar (I used 210 g)
* 1 cup white sugar (I used 160 g)
* 2 tsp vanilla extract
* 3 eggs
* 4.5 cups all purpose flour
* 2 tsp fine salt
* 2 tsp baking soda
* 1 cup nuts (I omitted these)
* 1 large package of chocolate chips (I used 210 g)

### Instructions

1. Cream shortening until smooth (about a minute).
1. Add sugar gradually until incorporated.
1. Add vanilla and eggs, beating well after each egg.
1. Sift flour, salt, and baking soda into a separate bowl, and mix well.
1. Add to creamed mixture until incorporated.
1. Fold in chocolate chips.
1. Bake at 375 °F for 10 minutes.

I baked them in my toaster oven on the middle rack.

## Round 1

* room temperature dough
* 375 °F
* 8 minutes

## Round 2

* dough chilled for 2 hours
* 375 °F
* 10 minutes

## Round 3

* dough chilled for 6 hours
* 350 °F
* 10 minutes

## Round 4

* dough chilled for 6 hours
* 350 °F
* 12 minutes

My favourite!

## Round 5

* room temperature dough
* 350 °F
* 12 minutes

Looks like temperature of the dough before baking does make a big difference, because these are visibly browner than the previous batch, which were baked for the same time and at the same temperature.
