* TOC

So this is my first "test kitchen" recipe, where I make the same recipe a bunch of times, each with slight variations, to find the *Goldilocks* batch of chocolate chip cookies.

I baked them in my toaster oven on the middle rack.

## Round 1

* room temperature dough
* 375 °F
* 8 minutes

## Round 2

* dough chilled for 2 hours
* 375 °F
* 10 minutes

## Round 3

* dough chilled for 6 hours
* 350 °F
* 10 minutes

## Round 4

* dough chilled for 6 hours
* 350 °F
* 12 minutes

My favourite!

## Round 5

* room temperature dough
* 350 °F
* 12 minutes

Looks like temperature of the dough before baking does make a big difference, because these are visibly browner than the previous batch, which were baked for the same time and at the same temperature.
