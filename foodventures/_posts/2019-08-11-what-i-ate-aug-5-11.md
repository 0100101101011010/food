### Two-Ingredient Greek Yogurt Naan

![two-ingredient greek yogurt naan bread](/food/foodventures/images/greek-yogurt-naan-1.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right}

You've probably seen this recipe before, because it's one that was quite viral at some point. However, the title is sort of misleading because you technically need three ingredients (self-rising flour, greek yogurt, and *salt*) to turn out something edible, and who keeps self-rising flour at home, so it's more like four ingredients (flour, *baking soda*, greek yogurt, and salt).

I made these once last fall, and remember being pretty impressed by the flavour even though I totally burned the whole batch. For some reason, these ones didn't turn out as great. Or maybe it's because as my bread-making skills have gotten better, I've developed higher standards for my bread? Either way, I was mostly disappointed by the lack of air pockets that you'd expect in naan. These looked, and tasted, quite flat. They are good enough as a vehicle for curry (which is what I made them for) but nothing beyond that.

### Mango Toast

![mango on toast](/food/foodventures/images/mango-toast.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right}

This is what it looks like: I put sliced up pieces of mango onto my [homemade bread](#parker-house-rolls-and-loaf) and toasted them. I was kinda inspired by avocado toast, I guess? I've seen mango toast on Instagram as well, but obviously a lot more aesthetic than mine. Although I like most fruit after it's been roasted a little (especially apples and peaches... mmm), turns out mango is not one of those fruits. Maybe it was because I didn't heat them long enough for the sugars to start caramelizing, but toasting mango did nothing to enhance its flavour for me.

### Parker House Rolls and Loaf

![parker house rolls](/food/foodventures/images/parker-house-rolls-1.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right} ![dough for parker house rolls](/food/foodventures/images/parker-house-dough.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right}

![parker house rolls](/food/foodventures/images/parker-house-loaf-2.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right}

I made these [Parker House Rolls](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/parker-house-rolls/) to eat with the stuffed mushroom filling that I didn't quite use up from [last Saturday's recipe](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jul-29-aug-04/#stuffed-mushrooms). The instructions for shaping the rolls were a bit vague, so I used [The Kitchn](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-parker-house-rolls-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-203112)'s post, which has really helpful pictures of each step. The recipe ended up making *a lot* of dough, so I experimented with it a bit. The first batch, I made typical Parker House Rolls in their off-center folded shape. The second batch, I baked as a loaf.

The third batch was bagel-shaped, baked on a doughnut pan.

Finally, I had a small ball of dough left over, so I shaped those into two regular buns, which I'll use for sandwiches.

The loaf is my proudest achievement. I seriously think this is the best loaf of white bread I've baked so far. The crumb is tight enough to hold the structure together when sliced, and the colour and rise on these babies are just perfect.

Finally, after an entire term of practice, I can make regular grocery store white bread. Yay!

### Honey Garlic Roasted Chicken with Cauliflower

![honey-garlic roasted chicken with cauliflower](/food/foodventures/images/honey-garlic-chicken-cauliflower.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

Trying yet another chicken marinade today! This one is a honey–garlic blend from [](). I rubbed the sauce on the chicken leg in the morning and let it rest in the fridge for half a day before roastng it for dinner.

Cauliflower was the usual, toss in some chicken stock and roast for 15 minutes on each side.

Cauliflower needs to cook at 400 °F for at least 15 minutes each side to be tender. But 30 minutes uncovered will cause the chicken to dry out. So my plan for next time is to turn the heat up to 450 °F and cook the cauli for 10 minutes on each side. I think this should be short enough to keep the chicken moist, while at the same time the high heat can ensure a crispier skin and a faster cooking time for the cauliflower.

Unfortunately Kevin said there was still something off about today's cauliflower. At this point, I'm at a total loss. I think the only variable it comes down to at this point is the fact that the cauliflower I used last time that he really loved was organic, while these ones weren't. I'm very hesitant to believe something like that alone could make such a huge difference in taste, but I will be buying organic cauliflower soon and repeating the recipe to test this theory. Stay tuned!

### Tofu Bok Choy Mushroom Burrito

![tofu, bok choy, mushroom burrito](/food/foodventures/images/tofu-bok-choy-mushroom-burrito.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right}

Pretty weird burrito filling, right? This is the [leftover dumpling filling]() from ASDF that I didn't manage to use up before I ran out of wrappers. I sauteed them together in a pan on low heat to drive off the remaining moisture, then wrapped it up into one healthy, tasty burrito. I was surprised at how good this tasted, but then again it tastes good in a dumpling, so why shouldn't it taste good in a burrito, right?

I drizzled some spicy mayo on there between bites and that made it 10 times better. I swear this spicy mayo goes with everything.

### Canadian War Cake

![canadian war cake](/food/foodventures/images/canadian-war-cake-1.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

The name of this cake sounds a bit aggressive, but it's a fitting descriptor because this was a cake made during WWII, when food supplies in Canada were rationed. The batter uses no butter or eggs and as a result it's a super economical recipe that uses what you can always expect to have on hand.

![canadian war cake](/food/foodventures/images/canadian-war-cake-2.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

It's not an exclusively Canadian recipe either, because Googling it turns up results for similar cakes made throughout North America using a boiled syrup mixture of sugar and raisins mixed with flour. Variations of this cake go by names like "depression cake" and "boiled cake." Absolutely 0 of these names sound appetizing, but I really wanted to give it a try because 1) it's Canadian!! and 2) how good can a cake with so few ingredients taste?

![canadian war cake batter](/food/foodventures/images/canadian-war-cake-4.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right}

To make the batter, you first boil the sugar, raisins, and shortening together to make a sort of runny syrup. After letting it cool for a few minutes, you stir in flour and baking soda. It looks awful, doesn't it? Be careful not

![canadian war cake](/food/foodventures/images/canadian-war-cake-3.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

From this brown and lumpy batter, you can actually make a pretty nice cake. It's not fancy by any means, with nothing in the way of decoration like an icing or glaze or some powdered sugar on top. But the cakes I make for personal consumption don't usually have those either (I find the cake sponge itself tasty enough without that extra sugar).

The texture is a little bit gluey (is this what Paul Hollywood means when he says something is "claggy?") but it's pretty enjoyable!

### Apple Turnovers

This was literally baked at the last minute before I had to go write my Chemistry exam. Nothing to take your mind off your impending doom than to do some baking! I had a tube of Pillsbury Crescent Roll Dough in the fridge that I wanted to use up before it expired.

It's my first time using this stuff, and hmm, it's saltier than I expected? It wasn't too much of a problem because I used Empire apples, which are very sweet.

![apple turnovers](/food/foodventures/images/apple-turnovers.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

Basically, I smeared some apple pie spice (2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cardamom, ur welcome) on each of the eight pieces of triangular dough. Then I placed a quarter of an apple at the larger end of the triangle and rolled it up, like an overweight croissant. I didn't find it necessary to add any sugar because of the sweetness of the apples, but feel free to do so.

I baked at 350 °F until the top looked golden brown, which took about 15 minutes.

After all was said and done, I found the pre-made crescent roll dough... underwhelming. I don't make pastry much to begin with, so I think for the future I'd rather just take the time to make my own dough from scratch. I'm excited to start experimenting with some vegan pastries.

### Shrimp Scampi with Fettucine

Well it's about time I used up some of the shrimp that's filling up our freezer!!

![shrimp scampi with fettucine](/food/foodventures/images/shrimp-scampi-fettucine-1.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}

I started by defrosting 1 lb of shrimp (about 24 shrimps—is shrimps the proper plural word?), peeling them and frying the shells in a generous amount of olive oil. Meanwhile, I drizzled the peeled shrimps in more olive oil and tossed them with 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp minced garlic.

I also think you should get your pasta boiling at this point, I didn't know this but fettucine takes so much longer than spaghetti to boil (it seems obvious now given the size difference, yeah), so I started cooking the pasta towards the end and the shrimp was cold by the time it was ready. Anyway, boil some salted water and put your 4 oz of dry pasta in. (I cooked 8 oz and I think it was way too much fettucine for two people. It was a bit bland and there was such a large pasta to shrimp ratio. I was completely stuffed after the meal and Kevin also said it was too much food, even though he was very hungry and ate it all anyway. Next time I would do maybe 4 oz of dry pasta for two people, that sounds reasonable.)

When the shrimp shells are a bright orange-pink and beginning to char, press them against the edge of the pan to squeeze the oil out and scoop them out and discard them, keeping the nice infused oil for the next step.

Add 1–2 tbsp of butter or margarine to the pan. Once it's all melted, add 1.5 tbsp of minced garlic and 1 tsp of red pepper flakes. So uh, you're gonna start choking at this point because man, the red pepper fumes are *spicy!* But just turn your head away from the stove to breathe and you'll feel better. Right after you add the garlic and red pepper flakes, add the shrimp mixture and saute for 2–3 minutes or until they are mostly pink.

Pour in 1/4 cup of white wine and 1/4 cup of lemon juice. Once the liquid starts bubbling, move the pan off the heat.

Your pasta should be done or close to done, and once it is, add it to the pan with the shrimp. Toss to mix and transfer to two plates. Grate half a lemon over each, sprinkle some parsley, black pepper, and parmesan cheese, and serve.

If you want this to be an even quicker dinner, use pre-peeled shrimp and skip the oil infusion step at the beginning. Also, it's so important to start the noodles early or you'll be stuck waiting for them to cook while everything else gets cold.

![shrimp scampi with fettucine and bacon-wrapped green beans](/food/foodventures/images/shrimp-scampi-fettucine-2.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-left}

For Kevin's dish, I also made a couple of bacon-wrapped green bean bundles to get him some veggies. I came upon the recipe while I was doing research for the shrimp scampi, and it was just perfect that I had some green beans sitting in the freezer! I steamed them for 0 minutes in the Instant Pot before following [this recipe](https://www.reddit.com/r/GifRecipes/comments/5o7wyl/3course_shrimp_scampi_dinner/dcha9lm/) to cook them with the bacon.

Kevin was very unsatisfied with how little bacon there was per bundle. He complained he couldn't even taste the bacon under the taste of the green beans! But he still finished eating everything and I am very proud of him :-)
