## Monday

I'm making a [slow cooker spare ribs](https://paleoleap.com/slow-cooked-pork-spare-ribs/) recipe today for Kevin's dinner. It turns out that the ribs I bought last weekend for making pulled pork are, in fact, not the best cut of meat for pulled pork. The best for pulled pork is a thick slab of meat like pork shoulder or something. Meat and its different cuts are endlessly confusing to me! Fortunately, I was able to find a super easy "set and forget" recipe. I got up early this morning and put everything in the Instant Pot, leaving it on the "Mid" heat setting for 12 hours. I'll check on it when I come back from class in the evening
