### Slow Cooker Spare Ribs

![slow cooker spare ribs](/food/foodventures/images/slow-cooker-spare-ribs.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-left}

I'm making a [slow cooker spare ribs](https://paleoleap.com/slow-cooked-pork-spare-ribs/) recipe today for Kevin's dinner. It turns out that the ribs I bought last weekend for making pulled pork are, in fact, not the best cut of meat for pulled pork. (The best for pulled pork is a thick slab of meat like pork shoulder or something. Meat and its different cuts are endlessly confusing to me!) Fortunately, I was able to find a super simple "set and forget" recipe. I got up early this morning and put everything in the Instant Pot, leaving it on the "Mid" heat setting for 12 hours. I'll check on it when I come back from class in the evening.

Update: I checked the internal temperature of the ribs at 11 hours, and it was barely 170 °F. I felt iffy about that, even though the meat seemed pretty tender, since I thought it should've hit 200 °F or something. I let it run for another hour at "High." This time I pulled it out, the meat was literally falling off the bones, and the thermometer registered over 180 °F, definitely safe to eat. However, after pulling it out of the cooking juices, I saw that the meat was all slimy looking and not super appetizing, and moreover, it didn't smell amazing, so I slathered on some BBQ sauce and quickly put it under the broiler setting (500 °F) of the oven for a minute. I was *so nervous* watching Kevin take his first bite. He chewed and chewed, and slowly came the verdict...

He liked it!!

I swear I breathed the biggest sigh of relief I have all year :-D I was so happy! I guess that unappetizing smell I thought I smelled was just me, because Kevin said it tasted absolutely fine and no stinky odours at all. He even said that the BBQ sauce (which I used to try to hide any possibly bad original flavours) was unnecessary, although that made it taste extra good. This means Kevin's lunch and dinner are taken care of tomorrow and I don't have to throw out 3 lbs of good quality spare ribs!

Kevin liked it so much he wanted me to make ribs at least every week. I'm excited, because slow cooking is just *made* for ribs and there are so many recipes for them out there. Lots of room to experiment and play around with the sauces. It looks like my Instant Pot's "high" slow cooking setting is pretty much the equivalent to "low" on a real Crockpot, so I won't waste time with the "low" and "mid" temperatures anymore. Also, Kevin noted the ribs that had been submerged in the cooking liquid were way more tender than the ones that stuck out in the air (falling off the bone vs difficult to detach from the bone). So to cook them evenly next time, I'll have to either use more liquid to cover all the pieces or pack the pieces more closely at the bottom of the pot.

### Vegan Fajitas

I used the [lentil](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jul-1-7/#mock-taco-bell-crunchwrap-supremes) recipe for the tortillas, this time mixing some salt and pepper into the batter. This helps the flavour a lot and is a real improvement from last time!

## Tuesday

I've been following a diet for the past few days called "OMAD," short for "One Meal A Day." It is what it sounds like: you eat all of your calories for the day within a short period of time, an hour or so. No food for the other 23 hours. Have you heard of it? I would love to know about your experiences if you've used this diet. I'm not even a week in, but I really enjoy it right now. Instead of limiting myself to three low-calorie meals a day, I can pig out on one big meal that makes me really full. I'm one of those people who can eat *a lot* at once, so this diet works well for me.

### Blueberry Okara Muffins

![blueberry okara muffins](/food/foodventures/images/blueberry-okara-muffins-1.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-left}

I woke up this morning meaning to make some orange muffins with the remaining three oranges we have, but realized I have a ton of okara in the fridge that I need to find a use for. These [vegan blueberry muffins](https://runawayrice.com/desserts/blueberry-okara-muffins/#recipe) were one of the first results in Google for "blueberry muffins," and the rating looked pretty good, so I gave them a shot! The batter was very easy to whip up (like 99% of muffin batters, tbh), and when I spooned them into the muffin cups created some lovely blue-gold swirls.

I changed the recipe slightly by using 210 g of okara instead of 170 g, and only used 100 g (roughly 1/2 cup) of sugar. I also reduced the oil to 13 g (1 tbsp). These take longer to bake than the instructions indicated, especially if you want the tops to get brown. I baked them for 25 min at 375

### Coconut Okara Cookies

![coconut okara cookies](/food/foodventures/images/okara-coconut-cookies-1.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-left}

I admit, I was super skeptical about these cookies. Even the photos on the [recipe page](https://blog.fatfreevegan.com/2008/09/okara-or-tofu-coconut-cookies.html) don't look enticing, being a pile of beige, homogeneous flat lumps. And mine looked just like that, too. But once I had a whiff of them I realized they smelled pretty good! Then I tried one... and was pleasantly surprised! At 91 cal each (I made 14 cookies out of this recipe, following it exactly other than reducing the sugar to 100 g), and containing no butter or oil, they aren't the most addictive treat you'll eat in your life. But the crunchy exterior, the chewy interior, and the coconutty aroma add up to make this a surprisingly yummy cookie!

Hmm, speaking of coconut, I listened to a How Stuff Works episode today about a coconut cult.

### Cheese Scone

It's sad that after first year, the place I buy food from most often from on campus is DP's Browsers Cafe, also arguably one of the shittiest options for food. The fridge is perpetually half-empty, with the only options being stale sushi, soggy wraps, and dry pastries. Also, they sell packs of pre-packaged, hardboiled eggs for $2. Who even buys that?! There have been times when I'm desperate enough for some protein that I think about it, but I *have* standards. The thing is DP is located in a conveniently central location
