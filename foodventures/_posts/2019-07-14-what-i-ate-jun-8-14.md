### Slow Cooker Spare Ribs

I'm making a [slow cooker spare ribs](https://paleoleap.com/slow-cooked-pork-spare-ribs/) recipe today for Kevin's dinner. It turns out that the ribs I bought last weekend for making pulled pork are, in fact, not the best cut of meat for pulled pork. (The best for pulled pork is a thick slab of meat like pork shoulder or something. Meat and its different cuts are endlessly confusing to me!) Fortunately, I was able to find a super simple "set and forget" recipe. I got up early this morning and put everything in the Instant Pot, leaving it on the "Mid" heat setting for 12 hours. I'll check on it when I come back from class in the evening.

Update: I checked the internal temperature of the ribs at 11 hours, and it was barely 170 °F. I felt iffy about that, even though the meat seemed pretty tender, since I thought it should've hit 200 °F or something. I let it run for another hour at "High." This time I pulled it out, the meat was literally falling off the bones, and the thermometer registered over 180 °F, definitely safe to eat. However, after pulling it out of the cooking juices, I saw that the meat was all slimy looking and not super appetizing, and moreover, it didn't smell amazing, so I slathered on some BBQ sauce and quickly put it under the broiler setting (500 °F) of the oven for a minute. I was *so nervous* watching Kevin take his first bite. He chewed and chewed, and slowly came the verdict...

He liked it!!

I swear I breathed the biggest sigh of relief I have all year :-D I was so happy! I guess that unappetizing smell I thought I smelled was just me, because Kevin said it tasted absolutely fine and no stinky odours at all. He even said that the BBQ sauce (which I used to try to hide any possibly bad original flavours) was unnecessary, although that made it taste extra good. This means Kevin's lunch and dinner are taken care of tomorrow and I don't have to throw out 3 lbs of good quality spare ribs!

Kevin liked it so much he wanted me to make ribs at least every week. I'm excited, because slow cooking is just *made* for ribs and there are so many recipes for them out there. Lots of room to experiment and play around with the sauces. It looks like my Instant Pot's "high" slow cooking setting is pretty much the equivalent to "low" on a real Crockpot, so I won't waste time with the "low" and "mid" temperatures anymore. Also, Kevin noted the ribs that had been submerged in the cooking liquid were way more tender than the ones that stuck out in the air (falling off the bone vs difficult to detach from the bone). So to cook them evenly next time, I'll have to either use more liquid to cover all the pieces or pack the pieces more closely at the bottom of the pot.

### Vegan Fajitas

I used the [lentil](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jul-1-7/#mock-taco-bell-crunchwrap-supremes) recipe for the tortillas, this time mixing some salt and pepper into the batter. This helps the flavour a lot and is a real improvement from last time!

## Tuesday

I've been following a diet for the past few days called "OMAD," short for "One Meal A Day." It is what it sounds like: you eat all of your calories for the day within a short period of time, an hour or so. No food for the other 23 hours. Have you heard of it? I would love to know about your experiences if you've used this diet. I'm not even a week in, but I really enjoy it right now. Instead of limiting myself to three low-calorie meals a day, I can pig out on one big meal that makes me really full. I'm one of those people who can eat *a lot* at once, so this diet works well for me.
