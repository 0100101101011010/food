## Monday

### Spam and Sausage Pizza

![spam and sausage pizza](/food/foodventures/images/spam-sausage-pizza.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

I made another pizza using another ball of the same dough from [two weeks ago](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jun-10-16/#triple-meat-pizza), the one Kevin said was his favourite to date. I put roughly the same toppings on this one: spam, cheese sausage, and mozzarella. To my surprise, he hated this pizza. The crust was the problem; he said it "tasted weird." After watching him struggle through a few slices, I told him just to scrape the toppings off and leave the crust. No idea what changed between this one and the last. I had a little bit of the crust, and both of them taste the same to me.

The only difference was this crust was still too soft in the middle when I initially took it out of the oven (I forgot to account for the fact that I was baking this from the fridge whereas the other one was already at room temp). But even after baking for an extra ten minutes to stiffen it up, it was still no good. According to the bf, it was the taste of the dough, not the texture, that was most off-putting. It's frustrating, to be honest, especially because I have like five more balls of this dough in the freezer.

At least this is in line with his character. Remember when I was really surprised when he said he liked this last time because he ordinarily hates anything whole wheat? I guess last time was either a fluke or a whole wheat-tolerant demon briefly took possession of his human form, but now we're back to the regular Kevin we know and ~~hate~~ love.

## Tuesday

### Poutine with St. Albert Cheese Curds

![homemade poutine with baked fries, homemade gravy and st albert cheese curds](/food/foodventures/images/homemade-poutine-3.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

I did it! I finally achieved my dream of making poutine from scratch with real cheese curds! After looking for cheese curds at the supermarket in vain twice in a row, I found them today sharing shelf space with salad mixes and tofu. Looks like third time's the charm. I also made proper baked fries this time, instead of my [lazy method](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jun-17-23/#homemade-poutine-with-chicken-gravy) of smashing potatoes on a baking tray.

Although Kevin liked these fries better than the smashed potatoes, he would still prefer them to be deep fried. We've been debating getting a deep fryer, but I really don't know if I want

1. another machine to take up space in the kitchen
1. to deal with cleaning something so greasy
1. the risk of oil splatters and burns
1. having to buy so much oil

We also thought about getting an air fryer instead, but I'm afraid it won't taste the same to Kevin, who's particular about his fried foods. My other question is, why use a deep fryer when it looks like a saucepan can achieve the same thing? I just don't know if it's the worth the investment, guys. Do any of you own a deep fryer? Please comment with your experiences if you do!
