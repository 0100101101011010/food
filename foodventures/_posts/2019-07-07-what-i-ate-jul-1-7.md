### Poutine with St. Albert Cheese Curds

I did it! I finally achieved my dream of making poutine from scratch with real cheese curds! After looking for cheese curds at the supermarket in vain twice in a row, I found them today sharing shelf space with salad mixes and tofu. Looks like third time's the charm. I also made proper baked fries this time, instead of my [lazy method](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jun-17-23/#homemade-poutine-with-chicken-gravy) of smashing potatoes on a baking tray.
