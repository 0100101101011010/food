## Monday

### Spam and Sausage Pizza

I made another pizza using another ball of the same dough from [two weeks ago](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jun-10-16/#triple-meat-pizza), the one Kevin said was his favourite to date. I put roughly the same toppings on this one: spam, cheese sausage, and mozzarella. To my surprise, he hated this pizza. The crust was the problem, he said it "tasted weird." After watching him struggling through a few slices I told him just to scrape the toppings off and leave the crust. No idea what changed between this one and the last. I had a little bit of the crust, and both of them taste the same to me.

At least this is in line with his character. Remember when I said I was really surprised when he said he liked this last time because he ordinarily hates anything whole wheat? I guess we're back to the regular Kevin we know and ~~hate~~ love.

## Tuesday

### Poutine with St. Albert Cheese Curds

I did it! I finally achieved my dream of making poutine from scratch with real cheese curds! After looking for cheese curds at the supermarket in vain twice in a row, I found them today sharing shelf space with salad mixes and tofu. Looks like third time's the charm. I also made proper baked fries this time, instead of my [lazy method](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jun-17-23/#homemade-poutine-with-chicken-gravy) of smashing potatoes on a baking tray.

### Mock Taco Bell Crunchwrap Supremes
