## Monday

### Spam and Sausage Pizza

![spam and sausage pizza](/food/foodventures/images/spam-sausage-pizza.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

I made another pizza using another ball of the same dough from [two weeks ago](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jun-10-16/#triple-meat-pizza), the one Kevin said was his favourite to date. I put roughly the same toppings on this one: spam, cheese sausage, and mozzarella. To my surprise, he hated this pizza. The crust was the problem; he said it "tasted weird." After watching him struggle through a few slices, I told him just to scrape the toppings off and leave the crust. No idea what changed between this one and the last. I had a little bit of the crust, and both of them taste the same to me.

The only difference was this crust was still too soft in the middle when I initially took it out of the oven (I forgot to account for the fact that I was baking this from the fridge whereas the other one was already at room temp). But even after baking for an extra ten minutes to stiffen it up, it was still no good. According to the bf, it was the taste of the dough, not the texture, that was most off-putting. It's frustrating, to be honest, especially because I have like five more balls of this dough in the freezer.

At least this is in line with his character. Remember when I was really surprised when he said he liked this last time because he ordinarily hates anything whole wheat? I guess last time was either a fluke or a whole wheat-tolerant demon briefly took possession of his human form, but now we're back to the regular Kevin we know and ~~hate~~ love.

## Tuesday

### Poutine with St. Albert Cheese Curds

![homemade poutine with baked fries, homemade gravy and st albert cheese curds](/food/foodventures/images/homemade-poutine-3.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

I did it! I finally achieved my dream of making poutine from scratch with real cheese curds! After looking for cheese curds at the supermarket in vain twice in a row, I found them today sharing shelf space with salad mixes and tofu. Looks like third time's the charm. I also made proper baked fries this time, instead of my [lazy method](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jun-17-23/#homemade-poutine-with-chicken-gravy) of smashing potatoes on a baking tray.

Although Kevin liked these fries better than the smashed potatoes, he would still prefer them to be deep fried. We've been debating getting a deep fryer, but I really don't know if I want

1. another machine to take up space in the kitchen
1. to deal with cleaning something so greasy
1. the risk of oil splatters and burns
1. to have to buy so much oil

We also thought about getting an air fryer instead, but I'm afraid it won't taste the same to Kevin, who's particular about his fried foods. My other question is, why use a deep fryer when it looks like a saucepan can achieve the same thing? I just don't know if it's the worth the investment, guys. Do you own a deep fryer? Please comment with your experiences if you do!

### Mock Taco Bell Crunchwrap Supremes

![first attempt at mock crunchwrap supremes](/food/foodventures/images/mock-crunchwrap-supremes.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

Neither Kevin nor I have ever eaten at Taco Bell, but we both have heard so much about their legendary Crunchwrap Supremes. There has to be a hundred different DIY Crunchwrap Supreme recipes out there, and today I finally decided to test one of [these recipes](https://cookingwithjanica.com/homemade-crunchwrap-supreme-recipe/) out to see if it really is as good as every American hypes it up to be.

Short answer: yes

Long answer: Although these bear only a passing resemblance to Crunchwrap Supremes (I was missing lettuce and tostadas, minimizing the "crunchiness" factor, so really these should just be called Wrap Supremes), Kevin still enjoyed them. Making these was kind of an adventure. First, I decided I wanted to use this opportunity to try these [1-ingredient lentil tortillas](https://powerhungry.com/2018/05/1-ingredient-red-lentil-tortillas-grain-free-vegan/) that I've had my eye on for some time. Second, I didn't realize this recipe required nacho cheese until I was halfway through cooking the beef. [Budget Bytes' 5-minute nacho cheese sauce](https://www.budgetbytes.com/5-minute-nacho-cheese-sauce/) really saved my ass here because I managed to whip it up just in time before the beef and tortillas got cold. I also used a home-mixed [taco seasoning](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/46653/taco-seasoning-i/). So basically, I made three separate recipes this evening and it all came together to make three measly Crunchwraps.

They are really filling, though: Kevin ate two tonight and will eat the other one for lunch tomorrow. The only suggestions he offered were, of course, to add lettuce and tostadas because it was missing something crispy. I'm also planning to bake instead of pan-fry them next time, to make the outside tortilla a little crunchy as well. Maybe I didn't use a low enough heat setting, but cooking them on the skillet caused some parts to almost burn while other parts still remained soft.

Those lentil tortillas have pleasantly surprised me. They were very easy to make with my Blendtec, and are as pliable as wheat flour tortillas. I made them a little too thick this time, but nevertheless they turned out very good for a first run. I'm planning to use a little more water with the next batch to thin out the batter and make it easier to pour into a nice thin wrap.

## Wednesday

### Brioche Loaf

![brioche loaf](/food/foodventures/images/brioche-loaf.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-left}

Even though I made this brioche loaf [last week](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jun-24-30/#brioche-dinner-rolls) (recognize the flax seeds?), I'm only slicing into it now!

Disappointing, the crumb is too soft and flaky to work as sandwich bread, although I managed to messily spread some Laughing Cow cheese onto it. (I don't even know why I bought a package of Laughing Cow cheese in the first place, because I hardly ever eat it now. I've had it for months and it's almost reached its expiry date, so I'm just trying to get rid of it. I saw it mentioned on [/r/1200isplenty](https://www.reddit.com/r/1200isplenty/comments/af7zy2/i_was_really_craving_a_danish_and_toast_with/) that it goes well with honey on some toast, so that's exactly what I did here.)

Who would've thought it would be so hard to make a loaf of plain white grocery store style sandwich bread?

### Bacon Cheeseburger Casserole

![bacon cheeseburger casserole](/food/foodventures/images/bacon-cheeseburger-casserole-1.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-left}

I had to use up the rest of the ground beef I bought to make the [Crunchwraps on Tuesday](#mock-taco-bell-crunchwrap-supremes), so I settled on this recipe

## Thursday

### Beef Stroganoff

![beef stroganoff](/food/foodventures/images/beef-stroganoff.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-left}

I made Kevin this [Instant Pot beef stroganoff](https://www.wellplated.com/instant-pot-beef-stroganoff/#wprm-recipe-container-32742) for lunch today (using potatoes in place of mushrooms). I tasted some of the noodles as I was putting it into his bowl because it just smelled so irresistible, and I'm seriously so impressed! Frankly, if there weren't meat chunks mixed in, I definitely would've eaten more, but it only got a lackluster response from Kevin.

He says that he's just not big on creamy stuff, and that this same recipe would taste better with tomatoes. He had the same comments about the bacon cheeseburger casserole yesterday—he would've been much happier with a lasagna instead. I'm the total opposite. I don't like tomatoes very much and much prefer rich, creamy flavours to sharp, acidic ones. Maybe I've been focusing too much on what I think *I* would like to eat when I'm making his meals, rather than what *he* wants, if that makes sense. From now on, I'll be focusing on making more tomato dishes!

## Friday

### Spam and Sausage Pizza, Take 2

This pizza features the same toppings as the [Monday pizza](#spam-and-sausage-pizza), but were made on the trusty all-white NYT pizza dough instead of the whole wheat dough.
