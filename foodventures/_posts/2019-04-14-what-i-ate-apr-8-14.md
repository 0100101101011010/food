### Pistachio Cheezecake

The [pistachio "cheezecake"](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-apr-1-7/#pistachio-cheezecake) from Sunday night is ready to eat now. It was too hard to cut right out of the freezer, so I waited for ten minutes and then it became the right consistency. It cuts very smoothly, just like real cheesecake.

The taste, though? Underwhelming. The filling layer was grainy and the lemon was a bit too strong. The crust tasted too sweet and overwhelmingly of honey. The pistachios didn't resemble a crumb at all due to the large pieces.

The fault of the crust is all my own, of course, since the original recipe calls for finely ground pistachios and maple syrup instead of honey. But I don't think I did anything wrong with the cashew filling. It just didn't taste *right*. Not rich and satisfying like a cheesecake should be.

### McD's Apple Pie

![mcdonald's apple pie](/food/foodventures/images/apple-pie.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right}

Today is very junk food-y thanks to one of my managers. She gave me an apple pie from McDonald's and a bunch of Haribo gummy packs ([not the sugar-free ones, don't worry](https://www.amazon.com/Haribo-SUGAR-Classic-Gummi-Bears/product-reviews/B006J1FBLM)).

The apple pie was a favourite during my childhood (I remember several instances of begging my mom for these when we passed by a McDonald's). They don't taste as good as I remembered. Maybe that means my taste has become more discerning, so I guess it's a good thing?

### Beltsander Brownie

This [microwave protein brownie recipe](https://thebeltsander.org/the-beltsander-brownie/) sounded so promising...

I followed the instructions to a tee, except for using cow's milk instead of almond milk. It tasted *terrible*. After nuking it, it was all puffed up and risen for a second, but sunk immediately as I took it out of the microwave. It was so bitter (even though the protein powder is sweetened), with a gross almost-foamy texture, that I couldn't finish it.

Almost as bad: it was such a pain to wash off the caked on protein bits. Never again!

### NO-KNEAD BREAD THAT WORKS!!

![jim lahey's no knead bread dough](/food/foodventures/images/no-knead-bread-1.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right}

Holy shit I am SO excited about this.

This morning, I began a batch of Jim Lahey's famous [no-knead bread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ah9ES2yTU). I have to admit I was a bit nervous and skeptical, but it turned out absolutely amazing.

Unfortunately I didn't take much pictures throughout this whole process, but I'm sure I'll be baking this bread again in the future so stay tuned for updated photos!

I took a shower, prepared the dough, which took less than five minutes, and left for work. Actually ended up getting off work earlier than expected (YAY) so I had to wait another couple of hours for the proofing process to reach the 12-hour mark.

I took off the lid after 25 minutes, by which time the dough was mostly set in its rounded shape. The top was pasty white and still had a wet sheen. At 40 minutes (15 with the lid off), the top was a beautiful golden colour, but Lahey says the crust should look a darker brown, so I gave it another 10 minutes. Such a long impatient wait!! In fact, I'm typing this right now as I'm waiting in the final stretch.

... And there we go. I was too impatient to let it cool down fully, so I just let it sit for about ten minutes before tearing into it.

The crumb is open, fragrant, and wonderfully soft!

It reminds me of the sourdough bread bowls we had at [Bistro Boudin](http://www.bistroboudin.com/) when my parents and I traveled to San Francisco. In fact, I want to try making an even rounder bread to really put it to use as a bowl for soup!

### Stuffed Pepper Soup

![stuffed pepper soup](/food/foodventures/images/stuffed-pepper-soup-1.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right}

I'll be moving out of this apartment in less than two weeks, so it's time I finish up some of the food in the freezer. This is a bowl of the [stuffed pepper soup](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-feb-11-17/#stuffed-pepper-soup) I made back in February, it tastes just as good reheated in the microwave than it does fresh! Unfortunately the stint in the freezer didn't do much to soften the rice, which is still a bit undercooked.

Sorry this week is so short, guys, my diet has been all over the place and I haven't tracked most of it. #justbusyseasonthings

It'll be all over in two weeks, at least, and I'll be eating better soon!
