## Monday

### Parker House Rolls

I made these [Parker House Rolls](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/parker-house-rolls/) to eat with the stuffed mushroom filling that I didn't quite use up from [last Saturday's recipe](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jul-29-aug-04/#stuffed-mushrooms). The instructions for shaping the rolls were a bit vague, so I used [The Kitchn](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-parker-house-rolls-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-203112)'s post, which has really helpful pictures of each step. The recipe ended up making *a lot* of dough, so I experimented with it a bit. The first batch, I made typical Parker House Rolls in their off-center folded shape. The second batch, I baked as a loaf.

The third batch was bagel-shaped, baked on a doughnut pan.

Finally, I had a small ball of dough left over, so I shaped those into two regular buns, which I'll use for sandwiches.

### Honey Garlic Roasted Chicken with Cauliflower

Cauliflower needs to cook at 400 °F for at least 15 minutes each side to be tender. But 30 minutes uncovered will cause the chicken to dry out. So my plan for next time is to turn the heat up to 450 °F and cook the cauli for 10 minutes on each side. I think this should be short enough to keep the chicken moist, while at the same time the high heat can ensure a crispier skin and a faster cooking time for the cauliflower.

### Shrimp Scampi with Fettucine

![shrimp scampi with fettucine](/food/foodventures/images/shrimp-scampi-fettucine-1.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

Well it's about time I used up some of the shrimp that's filling up our freezer!!

I started by defrosting 1 lb of shrimp (about 24 shrimps—is shrimps the proper plural word?), peeling them and frying the shells in a generous amount of olive oil. Meanwhile, I drizzled the peeled shrimps in more olive oil and tossed them with 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp minced garlic.

I also think you should get your pasta boiling at this point, I didn't know this but fettucine takes so much longer than spaghetti to boil (it seems obvious now given the size difference, yeah), so I started cooking the pasta towards the end and the shrimp was cold by the time it was ready. Anyway, boil some salted water and put your 4 oz of dry pasta in. (I cooked 8 oz and I think it was way too much fettucine for two people. It was a bit bland and there was such a large pasta to shrimp ratio. I was completely stuffed after the meal and Kevin also said it was too much food, even though he was very hungry and ate it all anyway. Next time I would do maybe 4 oz of dry pasta for two people, that sounds reasonable.)

When the shrimp shells are a bright orange-pink and beginning to char, press them against the edge of the pan to squeeze the oil out and scoop them out and discard them, keeping the nice infused oil for the next step.

Add 1–2 tbsp of butter or margarine to the pan. Once it's all melted, add 1.5 tbsp of minced garlic and 1 tsp of red pepper flakes. So uh, you're gonna start choking at this point because man, the red pepper fumes are *spicy!* But just turn your head away from the stove to breathe and you'll feel better. Right after you add the garlic and red pepper flakes, add the shrimp mixture and saute for 2–3 minutes or until they are mostly pink.

Pour in 1/4 cup of white wine and 1/4 cup of lemon juice. Once the liquid starts bubbling, move the pan off the heat.

Your pasta should be done or close to done, and once it is, add it to the pan with the shrimp. Toss to mix and transfer to two plates. Grate half a lemon over each, sprinkle some parsley, black pepper, and parmesan cheese, and serve.

If you want this to be an even quicker dinner, use pre-peeled shrimp and skip the oil infusion step at the beginning. Also, it's so important to start the noodles early or you'll be stuck waiting for them to cook while everything else gets cold.

For Kevin's dish, I also made a couple of bacon-wrapped green bean bundles to get him some veggies. I came upon the recipe while I was doing research for the shrimp scampi, and it was just perfect that I had some green beans in the freezer! I steamed them for 0 minutes in the Instant Pot before following [this recipe](https://www.reddit.com/r/GifRecipes/comments/5o7wyl/3course_shrimp_scampi_dinner/dcha9lm/) to cook them with the bacon.

Kevin was very unsatisfied with how little bacon there was per bundle. He complained he couldn't even taste the bacon under the taste of the green beans! But he still finished them and I am very proud of him :-)
