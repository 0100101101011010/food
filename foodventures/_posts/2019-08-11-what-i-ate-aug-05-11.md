## Monday

### Parker House Rolls

I made these [Parker House Rolls](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/parker-house-rolls/) to eat with the stuffed mushroom filling that I didn't quite use up from [last Saturday's recipe](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jul-29-aug-04/#stuffed-mushrooms). The instructions for shaping the rolls were a bit vague, so I used [The Kitchn](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-parker-house-rolls-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-203112)'s post, which has really helpful pictures of each step. The recipe ended up making *a lot* of dough, so I experimented with it a bit. The first batch, I made typical Parker House Rolls in their off-center folded shape. The second batch, I baked as a loaf.

The third batch was bagel-shaped, baked on a doughnut pan.

Finally, I had a small ball of dough left over, so I shaped those into two regular buns, which I'll use for sandwiches.
