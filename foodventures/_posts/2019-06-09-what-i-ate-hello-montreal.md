## Monday:

## Thursday: The Special from Wilensky's, Ice Cream from Kem CoBa, and Tasting Menu at Toque! and Poutine from Chez Claudette

![view from the window of a montreal mile end airbnb](/food/foodventures/images/montreal-airbnb.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}

We got the most (food-wise) out of our first day in Quebec. Our Airbnb is in the middle of Mile End, which together with the nearby Little Italy are the hottest food spots in Montreal. Not only is Mile End a super charming and artsy neighbourhood, perfect for strolling around, it checks all the boxes for those of us here as tourists. It's less than a ten-minute walk to Laurier, the nearest metro station, and is surrounded by famous culinary establishments.

[Wilensky](http://top2000.ca/wilenskys/index.htm), the first stop on our list, is a very retro deli known for its beef salamiâ€“baloney sandwich, The Special. This unassuming little shop has been a Montreal icon since 1932, and is just around the corner from our apartment!

There weren't any other customers when we walked in at around 3 pm on a weekday. The menu is extremely sparse, with the Wilensky Special being the only hot sandwich option available, costing $4.17 ($4.61 with a slice of cheese). Be aware that they, like many of Montreal's other long-time establishments, *only accept cash!*

The interior looks like it hasn't been redecorated since the 60's. On the wall opposite the counter are dozens of photographs of Wilensky's staff with various people I assume are celebrities, although I didn't look too closely.

When we bought the sandwich, we were a bit underwhelmed. It looked like an extremely flattened burger bun, and you couldn't even see the meat between the buns. However, after my boyfriend took his first bite, he said he could definitely see why this is a "must-go" place in Montreal. Of course, I don't know for sure whether he said that because this is an absolute tastebud chart-topper or because it was late afternoon and the sandwich was his first meal of the day, but either way, I think this place is worth a visit because of its near-status as a historical landmark and its popularity with locals.

![ice cream from kem coba](/food/foodventures/images/kem-coba.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

Next, we visited [Kem CoBa](https://kemcoba.com/), an ice cream shop across the street from Wilensky's (and neighbours of the famous Fairmount Bagels... which we'll be visiting on Saturday). They are kind of known for doing everything well, from their soft serves (new flavours every month) to their unique hard ice creams to their refreshing sorbets. The line was stretching down the block at this placeâ€”apparently, today is the first warm day in Montreal all year ðŸ˜€â€”but it was worth it.

Kevin and I both got hard ice creams. They provide a lot of exotic flavours, like salted butter, thai tea, and durian. I ordered a half-scoop of pandan and a half-scoop of fig orange, both of which were great (but the pandan was *amazing*), while Kevin went for coconut. He didn't really like the coconut flavour, and I agree, it was quite average. I think if you come here you should try one of their one-of-a-kind offerings.

This is another cash only place, and our total together came to $6 pre-tax (for two small cups).

![bread basket at toque!](/food/foodventures/images/toque-bread.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

A small sandwich and ice cream scoop do not make substantial meals, though, so we were both pretty hungry by the time dinner time came around. We had a 5:30 reservation at [Toque!](https://www.restaurant-toque.com/) in downtown, so we took the metro there.

I'm gonna take this moment to shout out the Montreal Metro. The trains look clean and new, come pretty often, aren't too crowded, and it's very easy to figure out how to get to where you want. A total stress-free experience! Thanks STM!

Anyway, stepping into Toque! you immediately know you're in a fine-dining environment. I didn't think to take any pics of the decor, but I should have; it was a quirky, modern design, which matches the kind of food they serve.

There is a staff person for literally everythingâ€”your main server, sommelier, water server, bread server, bus boy, some dude to brush breadcrumbs off your table, etc.â€”so the service in general is prompt and professional. In addition, I've got mad respect for servers in Montreal because they have to be fluent in both English and French, which must be difficult in these high-end places where the food is already difficult to pronounce just in one language.

We decided on the tasting menu, which comes with seven courses, and a foie gras course after the second appetizer. And to start, we also ordered 30 g of caviar. (Yeah, we were really ballin' for this meal, but we're pretty much going to be eating street food for the rest of the trip so this makes up for it lol.)

![10 g of caviar at toque!](/food/foodventures/images/toque-caviar.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}

The caviar was served with potato chips and something that tasted like dill sour cream. I've never eaten caviar with chips before, and to be honest, I still prefer them completely plain because maybe I'm just a savage at heart, but they go surprisingly well with chips! The cream, though, was a bit too overpowering and kind of masked the taste of the caviar, so I opted out.

![amuse-bouche at toque!](/food/foodventures/images/toque-amuse-bouche.jpg){:width="70%"}{: .image-right}

The next course was the amuse-bouche, which was a single wild-rice chip adorned with oil powder and... a bunch of other things I don't remember. It tasted extremely healthy, which would set the tone for the rest of the meal.



![first appetizer at toque!](/food/foodventures/images/toque-appetizer-1.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}

**Course 1/7:** Our first appetizer was a scallop and strawberry ceviche in rhubarb water and olive oil, with cucumbers and onions. My boyfriend's commentary: "It surprisingly works." Personally, I didn't like it too much and thought it was kinda sour. I don't like citrus-y flavours in general so I guess that makes sense. My favourite part was the scallops.

![second appetizer at toque!](/food/foodventures/images/toque-appetizer-2.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}

**Course 2/7:** The second appetizer consisted of *the most tender asparagus spears I have ever eaten* and a asparagus-mushroom puree, with a thin salted cracker on top.

![foie gras at toque!](/food/foodventures/images/toque-foie-gras.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}

**Course 3/7:** After the second app, they served the foie gras, which is like the largest piece of the foie gras I have eaten in a single sitting. Honestly it was maybe a little *too* big; maybe 75% of the size would've been perfect.

It was served with some onions, pistachios, and mushrooms, two shortbread crackers, and a few drops of sour cherry puree. The foie gras tasted *especially* good with the crackers, which were a little bit sweet and paired perfectly with the rich savoury flavour of the foie gras.

![first entree at toque!: lamb shoulder](/food/foodventures/images/toque-entree-lamb-shoulder.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}

**Course 4/7:** The first entree, which our server called the "pre-entree," was a lamb shoulder with some herb leaves and two strips of dried mushroom (looked and tasted like bacon). I had a small bite of this one, but didn't really like it, so my boyfriend ate both portions. He liked it because:

> The tendon and meat went really well together: the tendon was soft but also very chewy, and they were able to infuse flavour into the tendon, which is hard to do. The meat itself was flavourful, but wasn't dry. It was a tender, flavourful piece of lean meat paired with a delicious tendon.

![second entree at toque!: duck](/food/foodventures/images/toque-entree-duck.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}

**Course 5/7:** Sadly both of the entrees were meat-based. This second one is duck heart and more duck meat (we do not understand duck anatomy LOL), paired with a turnip and other veggies (+ puree) that I forgot. I tried the duck heart and one piece of the meat, neither of which I enjoyed that much, but my boyfriend liked eating it. When I think of duck, the first thing that comes to mind is those dingy Chinese BBQ shops that sell cuts of crispy-skinned duck out of styrofoam containers. I honestly prefer those meats to this one, which was a little dry and under-seasoned.

![pre-dessert at toque!: cow cheese](/food/foodventures/images/toque-pre-dessert-cow-cheese.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

**Course 6/7:** For the pre-dessert course, we had the option of a cheese plate or a sweet mini-dessert. I picked the cheese, obviously, and Kevin chose the sweet option. My cow's milk cheese was basically a milder version of brie, which came with a berry puree and a thick cracker.

Kevin's sweet dish was just... indescribable. His words:

> It felt like I was putting things in my mouth but they tasted like nothing ... I didn't know what I was eating, but it wasn't bad.

ANYWAYS moving on.

![dessert at toque!: cheesecake, strawberry mousse, and cucumber sorbet](/food/foodventures/images/toque-dessert.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}

**Course 7/7:** And finally we arrive at dessert! There are so many things going on with this one tiny little dish. First, there's the slice of cheesecake, with raspberry crisps that give it a sour kick. Then, there's the bite of soft strawberry mousse. And lastly the most interesting piece: a cucumber sorbet! Even knowing that it was cucumber-flavoured going in, I wasn't prepared for just how weird but good it would taste. It was super refreshing and a perfect way to tie the entire dinner together.

![after-dessert bonus at toque!](/food/foodventures/images/toque-after-dessert.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}

The petit fours, which were maple candies and something-that-tasted-like-turkish-delights-but-probably-goes-by-a-fancier-name, were served with the bill, and were a cute and tidy way to end the evening.

I loved the meal in general, would probably have loved it more if I'd remembered to mention I don't really eat meat at the start of service, but nevertheless had a great time! This is one of the most expensive dinners I've had, but well worth it for the food and the experience.

![restaurant chez claudette at 9 pm on a weekday](/food/foodventures/images/chez-claudette-1.jpg){:width="100%"}{: .image-left}

Later that night, we were both feeling a bit hungry, so we headed out to Restaurant Chez Claudette, a five-minute walk away, for some late-night poutine. This is a yellow-walled corner restaurant with an old-fashioned and modest look, but when we visited at 9 pm, it was absolutely packed. Most people looked around our age and the place was as loud as you can imagine, so it's probably a popular hangout spot for students in the area.

![smoked meat poutine at chez claudette](/food/foodventures/images/chez-claudette-smoked-meat-poutine.jpg){:width="48%"}{: .image-left}

![classique poutine at chez claudette](/food/foodventures/images/chez-claudette-classique-poutine.jpg){:width="48%"}{: .image-left}

After standing for half an hour in line, Kevin ordered the Smoked Meat Poutine in the *grande* size (left), while I ordered their original Classique Poutine in *petite* (right). We then waited for another half hour for the food to be made, while surrounded by Quebecois yelling at each other from all directions.

It was well worth waiting amidst the chaos. The poutine from this place has the squeakiest cheese curds I have ever eaten to date. The fries are a wonderful dark brown colour, thickly sliced, and almost sweet. Although the gravy-to-fries ratio could be more generous, the quality of the cheese and the large portions of fries can hardly be beat.

Tomorrow is the start of F1 weekend, and we'll be attending Free Practice 2 in the afternoon, so I'll be posting some pictures of the F1 track along with the food we eat!
