We got the most (food-wise) out of our first day in Quebec. Our Airbnb is in the middle of Mile End, which together with the nearby Little Italy are the hottest food spots in Montreal.

[Wilensky](http://top2000.ca/wilenskys/index.htm) is a very retro Montreal deli known for its sandwich, The Special, which has been an icon since 1932! And it's a two minute walk from our apartment!

When we bought the sandwich, we were a bit underwhelmed. It looked like an extremely flattened burger bun and you couldn't even see the meat between the buns. However, after Kevin took his first bite, he said he could definitely see why this is a "must-go" place in Montreal.
