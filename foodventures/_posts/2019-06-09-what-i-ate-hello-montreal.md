## Thursday: The Special from Wilensky's, Ice Cream from Kem CoBa, and Tasting Menu at Toque! and Poutine from Chez Claudette

We got the most (food-wise) out of our first day in Quebec. Our Airbnb is in the middle of Mile End, which together with the nearby Little Italy are the hottest food spots in Montreal. Not only is Mile End a super charming and artsy neighbourhood, perfect for strolling around, it checks all the boxes for those of us here as tourists. It's less than a ten-minute walk to Laurier, the nearest metro station, and is surrounded by famous culinary establishments.

[Wilensky](http://top2000.ca/wilenskys/index.htm), the first stop on our list, is a very retro deli known for its beef salamiâ€“baloney sandwich, The Special. This unassuming little shop has been a Montreal icon since 1932, and is just around the corner from our apartment!

There weren't any other customers when we walked in at around 3 pm on a weekday. The menu is extremely sparse, with the Wilensky Special being the only hot sandwich option available, costing $4.17 ($4.61 with a slice of cheese). Be aware that they, like many of Montreal's other long-time establishments, *only accept cash!*

The interior looks like it hasn't been redecorated since the 60's. On the wall opposite the counter are dozens of photographs of Wilensky's staff with various people I assume are celebrities, although I didn't look too closely.

When we bought the sandwich, we were a bit underwhelmed. It looked like an extremely flattened burger bun, and you couldn't even see the meat between the buns. However, after my boyfriend took his first bite, he said he could definitely see why this is a "must-go" place in Montreal. Of course, I don't know for sure whether he said that because this is an absolute tastebud chart-topper or because it was late afternoon and the sandwich was his first meal of the day, but either way, I think this place is worth a visit because of its near-status as a historical landmark and its popularity with locals.

Next, we visited [Kem CoBa](https://kemcoba.com/), an ice cream shop across the street from Wilensky's (and neighbours of the famous Fairmount Bagels... which we'll be visiting on Saturday). They are kind of known for doing everything well, from their soft serves (new flavours every month) to their unique hard ice creams to their refreshing sorbets. The line was stretching down the block at this placeâ€”apparently, today is the first warm day in Montreal all year ðŸ˜€â€”but it was worth it.

Kevin and I both got hard ice creams. They provide a lot of exotic flavours, like salted butter, thai tea, and durian. I ordered a half-scoop of pandan and a half-scoop of fig orange, both of which were great (but the pandan was *amazing*), while Kevin went for coconut. He didn't really like the coconut flavour, and I agree, it was quite average. I think if you come here you should try one of their one-of-a-kind offerings.

This is another cash only place, and our total together came to $6 pre-tax (for two small cups).

A small sandwich and ice cream scoop do not make substantial meals, though, so we were both pretty hungry by the time dinner time came around. We had a 5:30 reservation at [Toque!](https://www.restaurant-toque.com/) in downtown, so we took the metro there.

I'm gonna take this moment to shout out the Montreal Metro. The trains look clean and new, come pretty often, aren't too crowded, and it's very easy to figure out how to get to where you want. A total stress-free experience! Thanks STM!

Anyway, stepping into Toque! you immediately know you're in a fine-dining environment. I didn't think to take any pics of the decor, but I should have; it was a quirky, modern design, which matches the kinds of food they serve.

There is a staff person for literally everythingâ€”your main server, a sommelier, a water server, a bread server, a bus boy, some dude to brush breadcrumbs off your table, etc.â€”so the service in general is extremely professional. In addition, I've got mad respect for servers in Montreal because they have to be fluent in both English and French, which must be difficult in these high-end places where the food is already difficult to pronounce just in one language.

![10 g of caviar at toque!](/food/foodventures/images/toque-caviar.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}

To start, we ordered 10 g of caviar, which was served with some potato chips and something that tasted like dill sour cream. I've never eaten caviar with chips before, and to be honest, I still prefer them completely plain because maybe I'm just a savage at heart, but they go surprisingly well with chips! The cream, though, was a bit too overpowering and kind of masked the taste of the caviar, so I opted out.
