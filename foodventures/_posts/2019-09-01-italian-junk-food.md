### Eataly

After dinner, we walked over to Eataly. I remembered being amazed by the Eataly in Rome the last time I'd visited Italy, so I told Kevin that this grocery store was absolutely worth a visit.

I'm trying to think of an analogous store in North America that readers can relate to, but tbh I don't think we have anything this high end. Maybe something like a really big, not-completely-whole-foods Whole Foods?
