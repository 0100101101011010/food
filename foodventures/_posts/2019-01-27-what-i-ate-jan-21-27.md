## Monday

### Navy Bean Soup

![navy bean soup](/food/foodventures/images/navy-bean-soup.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

Actually, I made this on Friday, but with the [Banh Mi Boys fast food and birthday cakes](https://kellyzhang.me/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jan-14-20/#sunday) going around last weekend, I forgot to talk about this humble soup! This is a navy bean soup that's very warming and gives me chicken soup vibes, even though it's chicken-free (because I ran out of chicken stock...).

After my successful [lentil soup](/food/recipe/savoury-lentil-soup-slow-cooker-instant-pot/) recipe two weeks ago, I felt encouraged to make another slow cooker soup. They're so easy, so healthy *and* so tasty.

This recipe is from [Mom, What's For Dinner?](http://www.momwhatsfordinnerblog.com/2012/06/crock-pot-navy-bean-soup.html) and is another set-it-and-forget-it meal.

## Tuesday

### Thin Mint Overnight Oats

![thin mint overnight oats](/food/foodventures/images/thin-mint-overnight-oats.jpg){:width="21%"}{: .image-left}

This is my second go with [Chocolate Covered Katie's Thin Mint Overnight Oats recipe](https://chocolatecoveredkatie.com/2017/02/23/thin-mint-cookie-overnight-oats/). The first time, I thought maybe I didn't add enough cocoa powder so it tasted kind of off. This time, I tried following the recipe exactly, except I swapped yogurt with cottage cheese. VERY DISAPPOINTING. It's very runny and doesn't taste like a thin mint at all. I'm going to throw my hat in for this one.

### Spinach Gnocchi

![spinach gnocchi](/food/foodventures/images/spinach-gnocchi.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

Spinach gnocchi: another disappointing recipe! I followed [a recipe from Caroline's Cooking](https://www.carolinescooking.com/potato-spinach-gnocchi/). No matter how much flour I added (over a cup more than what the recipe called for), the mixture was still relentlessly sticky and too difficult to handle. I tried to shape them as best I could, but it was so time consuming that I ended up throwing a third of it out. This is coming from someone who hates wasting food.

Also, I added literally the tiniest pinch of nutmeg, as per recipe, and that ended up making the whole thing taste so strange. I couldn't get rid of the pumpkin spice smell profile that the nutmeg evoked and it was honestly too disgusting.

### Vegetable Stock

![vegetable stock](/food/foodventures/images/vegetable-stock.jpg){:width="35%"}{: .image-left}

While recovering from the spinach gnocchi catastrophe, I did pull off one successful maneuver tonight, which was making another batch of vegetable stock. I have to say, I'm pretty good at this now. My freezer generally always has one full bag of veggie scraps, which I throw in the Instant Pot with eight cups of water and pressure cook @ HIGH for 30 minutes. Then I either quick release immediately, or wait ten minutes. (Depends on how I'm feeling; doesn't make a noticeable difference, imo).

I pour it through a strainer into a freezer bag (if I'm freezing) or a mason jar (if I plan to use it soon) and then I always have vegetable stock ready to go whenever I need it!

## Wednesday

### Tofu Avocado Mousse

![tofu avocado mousse](/food/foodventures/images/tofu-avocado-mousse.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

Tonight is a tofu kinda night!! First we have a chocolate tofu avocado mousse. Almost all dessert tofu recipes call for silken tofu, but I used regular fresh tofu. It worked really well. This recipe comes from [Plant-Based Cooking](https://www.plantbasedcooking.com/recipe/tasty-tofu-avocado-chocolate-mousse/), and I can't recommend it enough.

I made the recipe the night before and brought it in for work. I was afraid the avocado's taste might change from being oxidized overnight, but I couldn't tell at all. A refreshing change from my overnight oats routine.

Strangely, it left me starving after just a couple of hours, even though avocados are high in fat and tofu is high in protein. I thought it was nutritious enough to keep me feeling full for longer.

### Tofu Grilled Cheese

![tofu grilled cheese](/food/foodventures/images/tofu-grilled-cheese.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-left}

After work, I whipped up a quick tofu "grilled cheese" in my waffle maker using firm tofu and a few slices from a jalapeno cheddar cheese block, roughly following a recipe from [Aloha Tofu](http://aloha-tofu.com/tofu-recipes/tofu-firm/grilled-cheese-sandwich/).

Folks, I've got an announcement to make. Tofu does *not* taste good in everything. I love tofu and I love grilled cheese, but I think they go better separately.

I can't describe what I find so off putting about this flavour combo, but there may be a reason you don't see many *cheesy tofu* dishes. I prefer the pure "soy" taste of the tofu to remain unadulterated by the overpowering cheese.

### Peanut Butter Oats

![peanut butter oats](/food/foodventures/images/peanut-butter-oats.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

I got hungry again a couple hours before bed, but I was too tired to cook anything, so I threw together two of my staple ingredients to create this peanut butter oats bowl.

SO UNHEALTHY BUT SO YUMMY!!! This is literally the epitome of late-night snack: quick oats + crunchy peanut butter stirred together into a calorifically delicious bowl of fat and carbs. The human brain comes up with amazing ideas when it's hungry. I will say that this much peanut butter this late at night makes me feel bloated the next day, so overall this was not a good idea. :-(

These days, I'm trying to fight my peanut butter addiction, but trying to avoid pb just seems to lead back to consuming ungodly amounts at one time. I tried swapping in some [PB&Me Powdered Peanut Butter](https://amzn.to/2VqjWSl), which is supposed to be healthier, but it tastes nothing like the real thing. So for now I haven't found any meaningful solution to this.

## Thursday

### Matcha Overnight Oats

![matcha overnight oats](/food/foodventures/images/matcha-overnight-oats.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-left}

For breakfast on Thursday, I brought a matcha overnight oats recipe from [rachLmansfield](http://rachlmansfield.com/vanilla-matcha-overnight-oats/) to the office. It's so cool because it has no sugar!! The matcha and cinnamon satisfied my dessert craving enough that I didn't miss the sweetness, and the chia seeds gave it a gelatinous, pudding-like texture. I will be making this more often from now on, because I love matcha.

I made a smaller portion than normal, because for lunch we're eating on the company card today! ;-)

### The Modern Bowl at Cactus Club

![the modern bowl at cactus club](/food/foodventures/images/cactus-club.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

Our office held a little social for the co-ops this term, which included grabbing lunch at the Cactus Club near our building. I ordered the only vegetarian option on the menu (it was a set menu so very few selections), which was this amazing yummy salad bowl with half a grilled avocado. The avo was the best part, of course.

I was sooo stuffed after this, and not in a good way... my fitted dress pants were a little uncomfortably tight the rest of the day. The plate was mostly full of veggies, but believe it or not, it ended up being a lot of food. Maybe the fries that I stole from my coworkers' plates contributed to how full I felt too.

## Friday: Visiting Waterloo

I went back to Waterloo this weekend, so this week's foodventures journal is getting cut short. I did no cooking at all and ate out a lot, but forgot to take pics. I promise I'm trying to get better at that!
