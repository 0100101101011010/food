## Monday

### Avocado Alfredo

Tonight I tried making Chocolate Covered Katie's avocado alfredo sauce. Is it just me or does avocado develop a weird taste when it's heated? I'm finding that I don't like it in grilled cheese, or this alfredo thing. The flavour of the avocado overpowered the milk so much that it lost its alfredo identity completely. Also, since the only noodles I had at the moment were shiritaki, they really didn't help the taste issue.

Once I added the noodles, everything clumped together in one hard-to-move blob. It didn't look good, but I still had hopes for the taste.

Nope. All I could taste was the weird heated-up avocado smell, which gets more terrible as you eat. I'm never making this dish again.

### Oven-Poached Eggs

![oven-poached eggs](/food/foodventures/images/oven-poached-eggs.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

While the avocado sauce was cooking, I also prepared a pan of 12 poached eggs, using the [oven method](https://www.eggs.ca/recipes/muffin-pan-poached-eggs). I've never attempted poaching an egg the regular way, but it seems intimidating so I'm going to see if this method is successful.

Out of the oven, they look pretty good! Obviously, the shape is very... muffin cup like, and they have a slight silicon smell? taste? but hopefully that will go away once they're removed from the molds. Overall, they seem to be cooked well! The only change I would make next time is taking them out of the oven a minute earlier, since as you can see with this yolk, it's quite set already. I'm going to pack them into my work lunches and see how they taste.

## Tuesday

### Spinach Cheddar Waffles

![spinach-cheddar-waffles](/food/foodventures/images/spinach-cheddar-waffles.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

I made a batch of [spinach waffles](http://www.onceuponarecipeblog.com/2014/04/savory-spinach-cheese-waffles/) last night, and man am I blown away by this recipe. I accidentally use double the amount of oil called for, most of which leaked out of my waffle maker as I was cooking, but they tasted amazing regardless. Perfectly crispy and rich.

I wasn‚Äôt expecting them to turn out quite this well! Even though I like spinach to begin with, I think a spinach-hater would enjoy these too. They honestly don‚Äôt taste healthy at all, LOL. They were irresistible when I was making them (I had to stop myself from eating too many), but also surprisingly good cold, at lunch today.

## Wednesday

### Avocado Macaroni Salad

![avocado macaroni salad](/food/foodventures/images/avocado-macaroni-salad.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

Another [avocado recipe](https://yupitsvegan.com/avocado-macaroni-salad/#wprm-recipe-container-6497) since I need to use them up! This one uses *raw* avocado (yay) as the sauce for a macaroni salad. It's been so long since I've eaten a pasta salad so I'm actually really excited about this. It looks so colourful and healthy.

I think this is the first time in years that I've had to boil macaroni pasta... isn't that weird? I forgot about how much it foams in the pot, or how long it actually takes to become al dente. I'm terrified of overcooking pasta, so I took one out to taste so often that I probably ingested like five half-raw pieces lol.

## Thursday

### Apple Cinnamon Overnight Oats

![apple cinnamon overnight oats](/food/foodventures/images/apple-cinnamon-overnight-oats.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

Another day, another [overnight oats recipe](https://www.realordinaryfood.com/food-diary-jan-28-feb-3/)‚Ä¶ This one was quite good! Next time, I would chop the apples into smaller pieces to make them easier to scoop up, but no changes otherwise. It‚Äôs been really fun trying out all these overnight oats recipes (here‚Äôs another fun one [with blackberries](https://www.realordinaryfood.com/blackberry-protein-overnight-oats/))! Oatmeal every day for breakfast may seem boring, but not when I‚Äôm switching it up every day.

Also, how cute does my lunch look today?! Two poached eggs (yep, keeping them in the silicon cups is a lot less messy) and the avocado macaroni salad I made yesterday.

### Savoury Oatmeal

![savoury oatmeal](/food/foodventures/images/savoury-oatmeal.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-left}

After my last attempt, you‚Äôd think I would be traumatized from ever making savoury oats again. Think again!! I wasn‚Äôt giving up on the idea of oatmeal in a salty dish.

Oh She Glows is one of those websites I trust to put out consistently good recipes, so I had to give her [‚Äúyou‚Äôre so cheezy oats‚Äù](https://ohsheglows.com/2010/03/03/youre-so-cheezy/) a try. This is vegan, with the flavour supplied by nutritional yeast and a couple of spices, but I swear the cheese taste is so there. It‚Äôs warm, rich, full of flavour‚Ä¶ utter comfort food. Since I was nervous of another failure, I made only one serving to try. But it turned out so well that I‚Äôll have to make it again. Could be a good healthy substitute for mac ‚Äòn‚Äô cheese!

## Friday

### Apple Cupcakes

![apple cupcakes](/food/foodventures/images/apple-cupcakes.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

OMG [this recipe](https://www.momontimeout.com/caramel-apple-cupcakes/) blew me away with how delicious it turned out. While absolutely not the healthiest recipe out there, these cupcakes were worth the calories. Bonus points, it was super easy too. I mixed everything together with a fork and it came together in no time.

There is a frosting that comes with the recipe, but after tasting the cupcakes, I thought they were good enough on their own that any extra sugar wasn‚Äôt necessary. Certainly if I were baking this for an event (which I might in the future because I honestly don‚Äôt know who wouldn‚Äôt enjoy these) I would decorate them, but since I‚Äôm eating them all by myself why bother making it look pretty? üòÄ

### Takeout-Style Lentil Curry

![lentil-curry](/food/foodventures/images/lentil-curry.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

Something about this curry, in those black meal prep containers‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt help thinking that this looks totally like something you‚Äôd get for takeaway at an Indian restaurant.

Best part though is this is only 55 cents a container! The [recipe](https://www.thekitchn.com/slow-cooker-lentil-curry-261956) is for a slow cooker, so I just used the slow cooker function on my Instant Pot. I should heat it on Medium instead of Low next time, because the lentils and onion were still just a bit firm for my liking. (I think the Low setting on the Instant Pot is lower than what you‚Äôd find on a traditional slow cooker, like a Crock Pot, so it would take longer to cook.)

## Saturday: An Early Chinese New Year Dinner

No pictures for today. I went to a family friend‚Äôs house for an early Chinese New Year‚Äôs dinner. We ate some really delicious food, but I felt it would be awkward to snap photos at the dinner table hehe.

## Sunday

### Oil-Free Fries with Ranch Dip

Was feeling like junk food today, so I found this [oil-free french fry recipe](https://runningonrealfood.com/oil-free-baked-fries-vegan-dips/) with an accompanying garlic ranch dip made from tofu.

I sprinkled the fries with a little of everything: paprika, chili powder, black pepper, salt, cumin‚Ä¶ but I should‚Äôve been more generous with the seasoning because I couldn‚Äôt taste it in the end. Still, it was definitely tasty and hit the spot for my carb craving for today.

The dip has a beautiful consistency, but tasted like there was a little something missing. Needs some fat, or needs some more salt, maybe? Also, it made soooo much dip! I used maybe a quarter to finish all the fries (dipping very generously) and there‚Äôs so much leftover I don‚Äôt know what to do with.

### Greek Yogurt Bagels

There‚Äôs a lot of buzz about these [Greek yogurt bagels from Skinnytaste](https://www.skinnytaste.com/easy-bagel-recipe/)‚Ä¶ and I confirm they live up to the hype. Mine came out to 152 cal each, which is like half the calories of a store-bought bagel! I did make them a bit smaller, but still that‚Äôs quite a lot of calories saved without sacrificing any flavour. I made three of them plain and sprinkled one with dried onion flakes, which was my favourite.

### Protein Donuts

At the same time the bagels were in the oven, I was mixing up another batter, this one for [protein donuts](http://www.bruisesandcalluses.com/2014/11/protein-donut-recipe.html). (Mainly I was just excited to try out my doughnut pan.) I don‚Äôt have such a glowing review for this recipe. Sure, you do save over half the calories of a regular doughnut (mine were 94 cal each), but the taste is also probably half as satisfying.

More importantly, guys, do you spell it ‚Äúdonut‚Äù or ‚Äúdoughnut?‚Äù My autocorrect is telling me it‚Äôs ‚Äúdoughnut‚Äù so I guess that‚Äôs I‚Äôll be going with from now on. Is this one of those British vs American things?

###  Cinnamon Apples with Greek Yogurt 

I had a tub of Greek yogurt that was closing in on expiry, and even though I use a good part of it for the bagels earlier, I had a bit leftover. I followed [this recipe](https://aseasyasapplepie.com/apple-pie-yogurt-parfait/#wprm-recipe-container-12354) for making cinnamon apples (skipping the sugar, they were sweet enough already!), and tossed them in with the yogurt to make a little dessert.

Man, why haven‚Äôt I started cooking apples sooner?! For some reason, warm apples taste so much sweeter than when they‚Äôre raw? Honestly, next time I might just sprinkle some cinnamon on an apple or something and leave out the yogurt.
