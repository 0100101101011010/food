### Pressure Cooker Chicken Biryani

![chicken biryani](/food/foodventures/images/chicken-biryani-1.jpg){:width=40%}{: .image-right}

I made the [Two Sleevers' recipe for IP chicken biryani](https://twosleevers.com/pressure-cooker-chicken-biryani/) for lunch. The spices smelled so good when I sauteed them with a tbsp of margarine (since I was out of ghee). I also left out the cilantro and mint 'cause ain't nobody got time for that. They were not missed.

The only hitch I ran into was the step for adding salt. I am *terrible* at salting my dishes correctly, and when the instructions say, "salt to taste," or "pinch of salt," my fear response kicks in. Hastily, I decided on roughly 2 tsp of kosher salt. Only after I added it, did I think to check the comments on the recipe page for guidance. In fact, the author did mention in one of the comments that she used 3/4 tsp. Sooo... even taking in the fact that I used kosher salt, still definitely messed up the salt there, but Kevin had no complaints. However, he did mention that there seemed to be something missing in the dish... he couldn't pinpoint what it was, but said it probably wasn't the cilantro or mint that I left out. We have it narrowed down to either needing more salt (:-0 why do I find this unlikely) or addition of some spice.

In addition, I'm lost at how this recipe could be for six servings. It only made three moderately-sized bowls for me. So this meal is probably not going to be remade anytime soon, although I do want to try some other biryani recipes since Kevin enjoys them. I guess I'm just disappointed with the Two Sleevers recipe blog because it has a reputation for good Instant Pot recipes, but in both of the dishes I've made so far, Kevin has found something lacking.

### Community Meals, courtesy of EngSoc

Dinner today was brought to you by the Waterloo Engineering Society. :-) EngSoc is doing a new community meal initiative in order to, in their words, "promote a social, friendly environment which means if you're hungry, you should be ready to sit down and make friends!!" Maybe there's an implicit "for engineering students" in there, but others have told me that EngSoc events appear to be open to everyone, so what the hell, free food! And a three-course meal at that.

I had a lot of fun chatting with my tablemates (who both turned out to be in Science, not Engineering, like me LOL), and even though the food was strongly reminiscent of first year cafeteria meals, it was a lovely way to spend an evening.

![engsoc community meal: sandwich, soup, potato salad](/food/foodventures/images/engsoc-community-meal-1.jpg){:width=60%}{: .image-right}

For bread, we were each given one grocery store hot dog bun with big slabs of butter (not pictured). I dug into it immediately, because it was past 7 pm at this point, and I was *starving!*

The appetizer was minestrone soup, which was actually delicious. Minestrone soup is constantly wowing me with how good it is—it's never my first choice of soup, but whenever I have it I'm like, I could eat three more bowls of this.

Our mains were build-it-yourself rye sandwiches... the vegetarian option was three different kinds of cheese and baby spinach. I'm not complaining, I love both spinach and cheese! I also spread some yellow mustard on my bread slices, which added some sharp tangy flavour to complement the mellow cheese.

Finally, there were two potato salad options available: one with egg and one without. I liked the with-egg a lot more. The eggless salad tasted like it was trying to compensate with extra salad dressing, which made it too overwhelming sweet and sour for me. I ended up eating most of the spinach with the potato salad rather than with the sandwich. Guess what? Raw spinach and potato salad is actually a great combination.

![engsoc community meal: tiger brownie, neapolitan ice cream](/food/foodventures/images/engsoc-community-meal-2.jpg){:width=40%}{: .image-right}

For dessert, we were given the choice between two brownies (triple chocolate and tiger), in addition to a scoop of neapolitan ice cream! I don't like neapolitan very much, but I haven't had it in a while, so was happy to try a bit. It's still nothing special to me, but I don't mind it.

The tiger brownie tasted a bit like an ultra-dense chocolate chip cookie. It was delicious too, but overly sweet in my opinion. I liked how chewy it was.

After dessert, we stayed and kept talking for a while, and ended up getting roped into helping the EngSoc organizers stack away the chairs and tables. I got a great arm workout for sure this evening, and I'd say we definitely "deserved" our free meal, even though we aren't Eng kids :-D

### Chicken Burrito Bowls

![chicken burrito bowl](/food/foodventures/images/chicken-burrito-bowl.jpg){:width=60%}{: .image-left}

I came home after nine and Kevin had gone almost eight hours without food at this point, so he was very hungry and I had to come up with something quick. I settled on this [20-minute chicken burrito bowl](https://damndelicious.net/2018/02/26/instant-pot-20-minute-chicken-burrito-bowls) recipe from Damn Delicious. It took me longer than 20 minutes because I had to de-bone my chicken first, but the rest of the recipe went fast because there are no sauteeing steps or anything. Just dump stuff into the Instant Pot, and set a time!

I didn't have green chilis, so I used dried Thai chilis instead. (I'm not sure *what* green chilis are, if we're being honest—aren't most hot peppers, like jalapenos, poblanos, serranos, green?) I know Thai chilis are one of the hotter common ones, but this is my bf we're talking about, so I was pretty heavy-handed with them, adding 6–7 into the pot.

Kevin's main complaints:

1. Too spicy (maybe I did add too many peppers after all...)
1. Rice too mushy (probably because I didn't rinse them in my hurry to get this meal out, but I will also be more careful with measuring next time instead of eyeballing. Also, I didn't quick release quite on time, so probably added an extra five minutes to cook time.)

Other than that, though, he LOVED IT! He says that this can go into the weekly rotation as a regular meal, which is perfect for me because it's one of the easiest recipes ever.

Stuff he suggested adding for next time:

* Pineapple chunks

### Bok Choy in Garlic–Oyster Sauce with Cheesy Cauliflower Nuggets

![steamed bok choy with cauliflower nuggets](/food/foodventures/images/bok-choy-cauliflower-nuggets.jpg){:width="65%"}{: .image-right}

Before we left for Markham [last weekend](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jul-8-14/#saturday), I pre-made a bunch of cheese-stuffed cauliflower nuggets from a [Tasty recipe](https://tasty.co/recipe/cheese-stuffed-cauliflower-nuggets). I finally got the chance to try them today, and they were... disappointing. The cauliflower was not crispy at all, still soggy in fact, and developed a weird taste. They were extremely fragile and a few fell apart as I pulled them from the baking sheet. The cheese made it edible, but nothing more. I swear this is the last time I'm going to be making cauliflower or broccoli nuggets. All my attempts have been failures.

The bok choy I prepared, on the other hand, was absolutely amazing. I used an [NYT oyster sauce recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017698-baby-bok-choy-with-oyster-sauce). I did modify it a bit to make just one serving, and played around with the ingredients and ratios to suit my taste:

* 1 tsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp oyster sauce
* 1 tsp apple cider vinegar
* 1/2 tsp oil (literally the smallest splash)
* 1 heaping tsp minced garlic (I used pre-minced jarred garlic)
* 285 g baby bok choy, thoroughly washed

The sauce is so easy, I mixed it up in an extra measuring cup I had after dumping all the ingredients in. I steamed my bok choy instead of stir-frying it because it's healthier and I like the clean, fresh taste of bok choy on its own. I used my Instant Pot, on the PRESSURE COOK setting at HIGH for 0 minutes (yep, you can set it for 0 minutes!) and they turned out perfect: tender with a bit of crunch and still a very pretty green colour.

In all, both the bok choy and the sauce were 37 each, making it just 74 cal altogether for a satisfying umami bomb. And look at that volume, babie!

### Chicken Cacciatore

### Brunswick Canned Fish

I definitely didn't eat enough last night, because today I woke up freaking STARVING.

I decided to try out some of the canned seafood I bought. I seriously splurged on these when I went to the grocery store on Wednesday: they were on sale for 99¢ and I'm a hoe for sardines and herring, so I bought 20 cans! They're such a quick, easy snack when you *want some food right now* and want something flavourful, yet healthy. 

### Protose

![protose](/food/foodventures/images/#.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}

I fell into a rabbit hole reading about *protose* recently. This is a faux-meat product developed at the turn of the 20th century by the same guy who invented Kellogg's corn flakes. Mock meat is huge right now, with products like Beyond Burger and Quorn constantly taking up media attention, especially in vegan/vegetarian circles. Since it seems as though this category of food is a recent innovation, I was surprised to find out that protose, a wheat gluten and peanut butter concoction (I'm imagining a nutty seitan flavour?), was very popular in the 1900's. The history behind protose—and what it has to do with Kellogg's cereal—can be read about on [Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-history-of-fake-meat-starts-with-the-seventh-day-adventist-church) and the [Science History Institute's blog](https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/a-recipe-for-good-health). I find it so fascinating that even back then, vegetarians were coming up with ways to simulate meat.

The ingredients from a can of the stuff (according to a [Chowhound user](https://www.chowhound.com/post/protose-403213)):

* Wheat gluten
* Water
* Peanuts
* Soy oil
* 2% or less of soy sauce (water, salt, hydrolyzed soy protein, corn syrup, caramel color)
* Yeast extract
* Salt
* Hydrolyzed soy and wheat protein
* Vitamins and minerals [niacinamide, iron (ferrous sulfate), vitamin B1 (thiamine mononitrate), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride), vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B12(cyanocobalamin)]

The ingredients sound a little dubious, but since the first ingredients are wheat gluten and water, I guess this is an early Western interpretation of seitan. My eyes also immediately went to the yeast extract—omg, another marmite recipe?!—since, as we all know, my [absorption with marmite is well documented](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jun-17-23/#marmite-toast).

There are homemade protose recipes online, but I'm hesitant to throw a lot of ingredients at them, especially when the main ingredient is something kinda expensive like seitan. The three most promising looking recipes I've found so far:

* [Four Pounds Flour](http://www.fourpoundsflour.com/history-dish-mondays-protose/)
* [Herbivorous Rex](https://herbivorousrex.wordpress.com/2012/07/12/possibly-protose/)
* [Ellen's Kitchen](http://www.ellenskitchen.com/recipebox/glutpnut.html)
