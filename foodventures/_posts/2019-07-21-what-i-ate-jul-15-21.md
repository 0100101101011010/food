### Pressure Cooker Chicken Biryani

![chicken biryani](/food/foodventures/images/chicken-biryani-1.jpg){:width=40%}{: .image-right}

I made the [Two Sleevers' recipe for IP chicken biryani](https://twosleevers.com/pressure-cooker-chicken-biryani/) for lunch. The spices smelled so good when I sauteed them with a tbsp of margarine (since I was out of ghee). I also left out the cilantro and mint 'cause ain't nobody got time for that. They were not missed.

The only hitch I ran into was the step for adding salt. I am *terrible* at salting my dishes correctly, and when the instructions say, "salt to taste," or "pinch of salt," my fear response kicks in. Hastily, I decided on roughly 2 tsp of kosher salt. Only after I added it, did I think to check the comments on the recipe page for guidance. In fact, the author did mention in one of the comments that she used 3/4 tsp. Sooo... even taking in the fact that I used kosher salt, still definitely messed up the salt there, but Kevin had no complaints. However, he did mention that there seemed to be something missing in the dish... he couldn't pinpoint what it was, but said it probably wasn't the cilantro or mint that I left out. We have it narrowed down to either needing more salt (:-0 why do I find this unlikely) or addition of some spice.

In addition, I'm lost at how this recipe could be for six servings. It only made three moderately-sized bowls for me. So this meal is probably not going to be remade anytime soon, although I do want to try some other biryani recipes since Kevin enjoys them. I guess I'm just disappointed with the Two Sleevers recipe blog because it has a reputation for good Instant Pot recipes, but in both of the dishes I've made so far, Kevin has found something lacking.

### Community Meals, courtesy of EngSoc

Dinner today was brought to you by Waterloo Engineering Society. :-) EngSoc is doing a new community meal initiative in order to, in their words, "promote a social, friendly environment which means if you're hungry, you should be ready to sit down and make friends!!" Maybe there's an implicit "for engineering students" in there, but others have told me that EngSoc events appear to be open to everyone, so what the hell, free food! And a three-course meal at that.

I had a lot of fun chatting with my tablemates, and even though the food (especially the vegetarian options) was strongly reminiscent of first year cafeteria meals

### Chicken Burrito Bowls

I came home after nine and Kevin had gone almost eight hours without food at this point, so he was very hungry and I had to come up with something quick. I settled on this [20-minute chicken burrito bowl](https://damndelicious.net/2018/02/26/instant-pot-20-minute-chicken-burrito-bowls) recipe from Damn Delicious. It took me longer than 20 minutes because I had to de-bone my chicken first, but the rest of the recipe went fast because there are no sauteeing steps or anything. Just dump stuff into the Instant Pot, and set a time!

I didn't have green chilis, so I used dried Thai chilis instead. (I'm not sure *what* green chilis are, if we're being honest—aren't most hot peppers, like jalapenos, poblanos, serranos, green?) I know Thai chilis are one of the hotter common ones, but this is my bf we're talking about, so I was pretty heavy-handed with them, adding 6–7 into the pot.

Kevin's main complaints:

1. Too spicy (maybe I did add too many peppers after all...)
1. Rice too mushy (probably because I didn't rinse them in my hurry to get this meal out, but I will also be more careful with measuring next time instead of eyeballing. Also, I didn't quick release quite on time, so probably added an extra five minutes to cook time.)

Other than that, though, he LOVED IT! He says that this can go into the weekly rotation as a regular meal

### Protose

![protose](/food/foodventures/images/#.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}

I fell into a rabbit hole reading about *protose* recently. This is a faux-meat product developed at the turn of the 20th century by the same guy who invented Kellogg's corn flakes. Mock meat is huge right now, with products like Beyond Burger and Quorn constantly taking up media attention, especially in vegan/vegetarian circles. Since it seems as though this category of food is a recent innovation, I was surprised to find out that protose, a wheat gluten and peanut butter concoction (I'm imagining a nutty seitan flavour?), was very popular in the 1900's. The history behind protose—and what it has to do with Kellogg's cereal—can be read about on [Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-history-of-fake-meat-starts-with-the-seventh-day-adventist-church) and the [Science History Institute's blog](https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/a-recipe-for-good-health). I find it so fascinating that even back then, vegetarians were coming up with ways to simulate meat.

The ingredients from a can of the stuff (according to a [Chowhound user](https://www.chowhound.com/post/protose-403213)):

* Wheat gluten
* Water
* Peanuts
* Soy oil
* 2% or less of soy sauce (water, salt, hydrolyzed soy protein, corn syrup, caramel color)
* Yeast extract
* Salt
* Hydrolyzed soy and wheat protein
* Vitamins and minerals [niacinamide, iron (ferrous sulfate), vitamin B1 (thiamine mononitrate), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride), vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B12(cyanocobalamin)]

The ingredients sound a little dubious, but since the first ingredients are wheat gluten and water, I guess this is an early Western interpretation of seitan. My eyes also immediately went to the yeast extract—omg, another marmite recipe?!—since, as we all know, my [absorption with marmite is well documented](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jun-17-23/#marmite-toast).

There are homemade protose recipes online, but I'm hesitant to throw a lot of ingredients at them, especially when the main ingredient is something kinda expensive like seitan. The three most promising looking recipes I've found so far:

* [Four Pounds Flour](http://www.fourpoundsflour.com/history-dish-mondays-protose/)
* [Herbivorous Rex](https://herbivorousrex.wordpress.com/2012/07/12/possibly-protose/)
* [Ellen's Kitchen](http://www.ellenskitchen.com/recipebox/glutpnut.html)
