### Protose

![protose](/food/foodventures/images/#.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-right}

I fell into a rabbit hole reading about *protose* recently. This is a faux-meat product developed at the turn of the 20th century by the same guy who invented Kellogg's corn flakes. Mock meat is huge right now, with products like Beyond Burger and Quorn constantly taking up media attention, especially in vegan/vegetarian circles. Since it seems as though this category of food is a recent innovation, I was surprised to find out that protose, a wheat gluten and peanut butter concoction (I'm imagining a nutty seitan flavour?), was very popular in the 1900's. The history behind protose—and what it has to do with Kellogg's cereal—can be read about on [Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-history-of-fake-meat-starts-with-the-seventh-day-adventist-church) and the [Science History Institute's blog](https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/a-recipe-for-good-health). I find it so fascinating that even back then, vegetarians were coming up with ways to simulate meat.

The ingredients from a can of the stuff (according to a [Chowhound user](https://www.chowhound.com/post/protose-403213)):

* Wheat gluten
* Water
* Peanuts
* Soy oil
* 2% or less of soy sauce (water, salt, hydrolyzed soy protein, corn syrup, caramel color)
* Yeast extract
* Salt
* Hydrolyzed soy and wheat protein
* Vitamins and minerals [niacinamide, iron (ferrous sulfate), vitamin B1 (thiamine mononitrate), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride), vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B12(cyanocobalamin)]

The ingredients sound a little dubious, but since the first ingredients are wheat gluten and water, I guess this is an early Western interpretation of seitan. My eyes also immediately went to the yeast extract—omg, another marmite recipe?!—since, as we all know, my [absorption with marmite is well documented](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jun-17-23/#marmite-toast).

There are homemade protose recipes online, but I'm hesitant to throw a lot of ingredients at them, especially when the main ingredient is something kinda expensive like seitan. The three most promising looking recipes I've found so far:

* [Four Pounds Flour](http://www.fourpoundsflour.com/history-dish-mondays-protose/)
* [Herbivorous Rex](https://herbivorousrex.wordpress.com/2012/07/12/possibly-protose/)
* [Ellen's Kitchen](http://www.ellenskitchen.com/recipebox/glutpnut.html)
