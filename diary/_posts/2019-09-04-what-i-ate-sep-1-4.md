## Saturday

### Noodles at

After [touching down in Toronto](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-north-italy-edition-venice/), we took a rideshare back to Waterloo. Since there was nothing in the fridge, and I was too lazy to go out for groceries on our first day back, we went out to eat at a restaurant I've been meaning to try for some time.

Located in the Plaza, it's right next to Kismet in the place where Vegetarian Fast Food used to be.

## Sunday

Driving back to Toronto again today to help Kevin move into his apartment for co-op.

### Momofuku Noodle Bar

I guess after our stint in Italy, we are both craving something closer to home. Initially, we wanted to visit PAI, a Northern Thai place, but when we got there, the line was coming out the door! We weren't willing to wait, so we walked just a little further to another Asian restaurant: Momofuku Noodle Bar.

The layout of this restaurant is very cool. The entranceway is tiny and dark, but it emerges into a huge open space consisting of the main floor of communal dining tables and ringed by a partial second floor with bar tables, which is where we sat.

Kevin, unsurprisingly, ordered the ~~Very~~ Extremely Spicy Noodles, asking them to make it as spicy as possible. He also got a plate of pork belly buns to start.

I ordered the Potato Dashi Ramen, which came piled with ultra-crispy shoestring fries. The broth was sooo savoury! I am still not really sure what dashi is or what it tastes like on its own, but all I know is it was delicious in this soup.

The bowls were on the smaller side for a ramen place, especially given the price, but I think it's well worth a visit. You certainly won't leave hungry!

### Bubble Tea from Xing Fu Tang

I swear my boyfriend is the biggest hype man for Xing Fu Tang, a formerly Vancouver-exclusive chain of tea shops that has since opened a couple locations in Toronto. When we walked past one on the way back, he got really excited, and I was curious to try it as well, so we stopped for a little after-dinner snack.

I ordered their matcha latte (half sugar, no ice, as usual) and Kevin ordered the brown sugar pearl latte. It's funny that every tea shop is jumping on the brown sugar bandwagon now—for good reason, though, because those pearls really are a mile above regular tapioca pearls.

First, I appreciate the neatness and emptiness of the shop. Each table came with a cute little succulent. Maybe we came by at a downtime for bbt consumption, or maybe this brand hasn't yet established itself within the Toronto market, but there were only a couple of other people there.
