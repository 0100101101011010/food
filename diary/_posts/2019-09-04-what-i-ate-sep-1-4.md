## Saturday

After [touching down in Toronto](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-north-italy-edition-venice/#lunch-on-air-canada-rouge), we took a rideshare back to Waterloo. Since there was nothing in the fridge, and I was too lazy to go out for groceries on our first day back, we went out to eat at a restaurant I've been meaning to try for some time.

### Noodles at 白家老汤 (Northwestern Chinese Cuisine)

Located in the University Shops Plaza, it's right next to Kismet in the place where Vegetarian Fast Food used to be, and opened earlier this year, but we haven't had an opportunity to visit until now. According to their [website](http://baijialaotang.com/), the English name of this restaurant is "Northwestern Chinese Cuisine" even though this is nowhere on their storefront sign. Mostly, it serves noodles, along with some hearty rice dishes.

I ordered the "Multigrain Fish Rice Noodle in Special Soup," which turned out to be absolutely HUGE. Next time, I would definitely share one bowl between two of us because I couldn't even finish it, and you know how rare that is because I love noodles so much! The "multigrain rice noodles" were three different colours: white, pale yellow, and brown, and all were delicious, although I couldn't exactly discern a difference in taste between the three. Besides that, it also came with white fish fillets, thinly sliced wood ear mushrooms, peanut and sesame seed garnish, and pieces of lettuce. The broth was spicy, but just the right amount for me. The only issue was, because of the size of the bowl and the amount of soup, it took *forever* to cool down, and I burned my mouth a couple of times being impatient.

Food aside, the restaurant seemed pretty disorganized. The place didn't look too clean, service felt kind of rushed, and they began turning customers away halfway through our meal, even though it was normal dinner hours and the OPEN sign was still lit up outside. I'm not sure if it was an off day, but the ambiance definitely did take away from the experience a little.

I think I will still be returning to Gols and Izna for my Waterloo noodle needs, but the sheer diversity of their menu options warrants another visit in the future. I am excited to try their hand-sliced noodles some day!

## Sunday

Driving back to Toronto again today to help Kevin move into his apartment for co-op.

### Dinner at Momofuku Noodle Bar

I guess after our stint in Italy, we are both craving something closer to home. Initially, we wanted to visit PAI, a Northern Thai place, but when we got there, the line was coming out the door! We weren't willing to wait, so we walked just a little further to another Asian restaurant: Momofuku Noodle Bar.

The layout of this restaurant is very cool. The entranceway is tiny and dark, but it emerges into a huge open space consisting of the main floor of communal dining tables and ringed by a partial second floor with bar tables, which is where we sat.

Kevin, unsurprisingly, ordered the ~~Very~~ Extremely Spicy Noodles, asking them to make it as spicy as possible. He also got a plate of pork belly buns to start.

I ordered the Potato Dashi Ramen, which came with both slices of potato and a pile of ultra-crispy shoestring fries. The broth was sooo savoury, and the dollop of sour cream was unexpected but amazing. I am still not really sure what dashi is or what it tastes like on its own, but all I know is it was delicious in this soup. I tasted the fries on their own, the potato slices on their own, the fries with the broth, the fries with the broth with the noodles, the potato slices with the broth with the noodles, the fries with the sour cream... I might as well have gone back to my 12th grade permutations and combinations math lecture. Anyway, every component of the dish worked so well with each other, no matter how I ate it or in what order.

The bowls were on the smaller side for a ramen place, especially given the price, but you certainly won't leave hungry. I think it's well worth a visit. My ramen was not traditional at all, but it was delicious, and definitely a meal I'll remember.

### Bubble Tea from Xing Fu Tang

![xing fu tang toronto](/food/diary/images/xingfutang.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

I swear my boyfriend is the biggest hype man for Xing Fu Tang, a chain of tea shops he used to visit in Vancouver that has since opened a couple locations in Toronto. When we walked past one on the way back, he got really excited, and I was curious to try it as well, so we stopped for a little after-dinner snack.

First, I appreciate the neatness and emptiness of the shop. Each table came with a cute little succulent. Maybe we came by at a downtime for bbt consumption, or maybe this brand hasn't yet established itself within the Toronto market, but there were only a couple of other people there.

I ordered their matcha latte (half sugar, no ice, as usual) and Kevin ordered the brown sugar pearl latte. It's funny that every tea shop is jumping on the brown sugar bandwagon now—for good reason, though, because those pearls really are a mile above regular tapioca pearls. I wasn't blown away by my matcha, tbh it was just okay. Even Kevin's brown sugar drink, which he says is one of the best, tasted just fine to me. Honestly? I still prefer Kung Fu Tea, and even Coco.

## Monday

### Lunch at Bannock

![bannock box from bannock toronto](/food/diary/images/bannock-bread.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-left}

Of course, we got their namesake, a plate of mixed bannock bread with hummus dip. I've eaten bannock before and really loved how savoury and addictive it was, but the one I ate before was a thick, round boi while this fry bread was paper thin. Kevin likened it to a "less tasty *[cong you bing](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jul-29-aug-4/#scallion-pancakes)* (Chinese scallion pancakes)," and I have to agree. The flavour was so similar, just add a few handfuls of chopped scallions and you're set for an Asian breakfast. Nevertheless, it was quite delicious (*cong you bing* just sets a very high standard!) and we barely touched the hummus, the bread was so good on its own.

![mac and cheese from bannock toronto](/food/diary/images/bannock-mac-n-cheese.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-right}

I ordered the Mac & Cheese V, made with Ontario cheddar and some mushrooms and kale to make it ~~healthy, and topped with some ketchup chips. Very Canadian! I could've done with slightly less mushrooms, but other than that, it was delicious. They definitely weren't sleeping on the cheese.

Kevin ordered the Roast Duck Poutine, which our server specifically warned us that it would be "really, really big." I was apprehensive that she had to warn us about that, I mean it was only $21, how big can it be? As it turns out, she was right, I have never seen a more massive and loaded pizza in my life. It smelled amazingg. Kevin could only eat half before he was totally stuffed, and we packed the rest up to take home. It ended up being pretty tasty reheated the next day too.

### "Dinner" at Kinka Izakaya
