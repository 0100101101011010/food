excerpt: "It's another short post this week as I'm heading off to Italy on Friday. This week has been less than healthy because I've been a bit preoccupied with exams, and I've had no motivation to cook."

### Coconut Chocolate Chip Blondies

![coconut chocolate chip blondies](/food/foodventures/images/vegan-brownies-toasted-coconut.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right}

Since Kevin thought the [brownies](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-aug-5-11/#vegan-brownies-with-toasted-coconut) I made last week were too chocolatey and rich, I thought he would probably like blondies better than brownies. He did like the toasted coconut from the brownies, though, so I set out to find a recipe for coconut blondies.

The recipe [one I settled on](https://theconscientiouseater.com/vegan-coconut-chocolate-chunk-blondies/) calls for 1 cup of sugar (200 g), but I only used 75 g and it was plenty. I love sweets, but I can't understand how someone could eat something that sweet!!

## Wednesday

I defrosted a bag of corn and bread from the freezer last night. I made the bread into breadcrumbs (tear bread into small pieces, bake at 400 °F for 20 minutes, turning halfway), and for the corn I decided to make [corn cakes](https://www.sunset.com/recipe/fresh-corn-cakes)!

the cornmeal in the cakes gave me arepa vibes, but I missed the firmness of the arepas. These were very soft and fragile, and still kind of soggy inside even though the outside was on the verge of being burnt.

## Friday

As part of my [bake-along](/food/diary/jellies-great-british-bake-along-2019/) challenge, I made [floury baps](/food/diary/gbbo-bake-along-bread) (that's British for burger buns, apparently), and cooked up a batch of beef patties to serve with them. I found a super easy recipe for the patties

## Saturday

Kevin amazed me this weekend because he didn't want to go out to eat, at all. He preferred to stick with my home cooking!! (To be fair, mostly it was because he was too lazy to walk outside, but I am still super impressed.)

I was looking back at my old posts, and just a [couple of months ago in July](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jul-1-7/) I was celebrating the fact that we were able to go a whole week without eating out. This week, Kevin told me he wanted me to prep meals for him to take back to Toronto. We have come so far, from eating out for almost every meal back in first year, to having almost every meal at home now. I am grateful that my boyfriend is supportive of my cooking, and just really happy that he places importance on eating healthily and economically.
