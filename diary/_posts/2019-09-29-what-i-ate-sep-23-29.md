### Coconut Chocolate Chip Blondies

![coconut chocolate chip blondies](/food/foodventures/images/vegan-brownies-toasted-coconut.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right}

Since Kevin thought the [brownies](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-aug-5-11/#vegan-brownies-with-toasted-coconut) I made last week were too chocolatey and rich, I thought he would probably like blondies better than brownies. He did like the toasted coconut from the brownies, though, so I set out to find a recipe for coconut blondies.

The recipe [one I settled on](https://theconscientiouseater.com/vegan-coconut-chocolate-chunk-blondies/) calls for 1 cup of sugar (200 g), but I only used 75 g and it was plenty. I love sweets, but I can't understand how someone could eat something that sweet!!

## Saturday

Kevin has really amazed me this weekend because he didn't want to go out to eat, at all. He wanted to stick with my home cooking!! (To be fair, mostly it was because he was too lazy to walk outside, but I am still super impressed.)

I was looking back at my old posts, and just a [couple of months ago in July](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jul-1-7/) I was celebrating the fact that we were able to go a whole week without eating out. And this week, Kevin even told me he wanted me to prep meals for him to take back to Toronto. We have come so far, from eating out for almost every meal back in first year, to having almost every meal at home now. I am grateful that my boyfriend is supportive of my cooking, and just really happy that he places importance on eating healthy and saving money on food.
