### Coconut Chocolate Chip Blondies

![coconut chocolate chip blondies](/food/foodventures/images/vegan-brownies-toasted-coconut.jpg){:width="30%"}{: .image-right}

Since Kevin thought the [brownies](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-aug-5-11/#vegan-brownies-with-toasted-coconut) I made last week were too chocolatey and rich, I thought he would probably like blondies better than brownies. He did like the toasted coconut from the brownies, though, so I set out to find a recipe for coconut blondies.

The recipe [one I settled on](https://theconscientiouseater.com/vegan-coconut-chocolate-chunk-blondies/) calls for 1 cup of sugar (200 g), but I only used 75 g and it was plenty. I love sweets, but I can't understand how someone could eat something that sweet!!


## Wednesday

### Peach Steel-Cut Oatmeal in the Instant Pot

[Instant Pot official recipe site](https://recipes.instantpot.com/recipe/peaches-and-cream-oatmeal/), except I used quick-cooking steel cut oats instead of rolled oats.
