{{page.excerpt}}

We have been following each episode of Season 10 as it comes out episode by episode (I can't remember the last time I've done that with a television show, wow), and since the whole reason we got into this series was because I love baking, I figured why not attempt the technical challenges at home?

As you've noticed if you follow the show closely, this year's lineup of bakers is a lot younger as well, which is another inspiration for me. After all, if [Henry](https://www.instagram.com/henryfabird/) (the youngest contestant this year) can do these bakes, so can I! Of course, I'm not nearly as talented as anyone on the cast, but the only way to get better is to practice.

I'm hoping to be challenged beyond my usual rotation of plain bread loaves, chocolate chip cookies, and one-bowl muffin batters and to be introduced to some new baking techniques. Wish me luck! â™¡

## Episode 1: Cake

The first week's technical challenge for the bakers is [angel slices](/food/diary/gbbo-bake-along-cake/). I've never made genoise sponge before, or used fondant, so it should be a good learning opportunity for me!

[See my results here](/food/diary/gbbo-bake-along-cake/).

## Episode 2: Biscuits

## Episode 3: Bread

## Episode 4: Dairy
