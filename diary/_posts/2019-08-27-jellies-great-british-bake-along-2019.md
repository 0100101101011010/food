{{page.excerpt}}

We have been watching each episode as they get released (I can't remember the last time I've done that with a television show, wow), and since the whole reason we got into this series was because I love baking, I figured why not attempt the technical challenges at home?

As you've noticed if you follow the show closely, this year's lineup of bakers is a lot younger as well, which is another inspiration for me. After all, if [Henry](https://www.instagram.com/henryfabird/) (the youngest contestant this year) can do these bakes, so can I! Of course, I'm not nearly as talented as anyone on the cast, but the only way to get better is to practice.

I'm hoping to be challenged beyond my usual rotation of plain bread loaves, chocolate chip cookies, and one-bowl muffin batters and to be introduced to some new baking techniques. Wish me luck ♡

## Episode 1: Cake

The first week's technical challenge for the bakers is [angel slices](/food/diary/gbbo-bake-along-cake/). I've never made genoise sponge before, or used fondant, so it should be a good learning opportunity for me!

[See my results here](/food/diary/gbbo-bake-along-cake/).

## Episode 2: Biscuits

The issue with this one is I don't usually have figs randomly lying around the house, and they are kinda difficult to find in the stores here (not to mention expensive). I will have to think of a substitute for them when I get to this challenge.

[See my results here](/food/diary/gbbo-bake-along-biscuits/).

## Episode 3: Bread

Vegan burger buns (or as Paul Hollywood calls them, *baps*) are this season's challenge for the infamous Bread Week, complete with a vegan black bean patty! I'm pretty excited for this one—I've made a [pretty good batch](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jul-1-7/#hamburger-buns) of buns before, but have also had [less success](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-jun-10-16/#hot-dog-and-hamburger-buns) with them at other times—and I want to put Paul's recipe to the test with these other ones I've made.

I'm not too sure that I'll make the patty to go along with these, though. I still have some of the [okara crab cakes](#) from last week that would be perfect inside these buns, and since Kevin our resident bean-hater is coming over for the weekend, I will probably just make some traditional ground beef patties for him.

## Episode 4: Dairy

I've gone about two months without buying dairy milk at this point and I really don't want to break my streak. But this week's challenge, frankly, is going to be pretty impossible to do without milk. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with this one yet.

## Episode 5: The Roaring 20's

Like David, I've never made choux pastry before, never mind sabayon, so this will be another great learning experience for me.
