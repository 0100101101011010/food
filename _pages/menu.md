### Meat Dinner: [Crunchwrap Supreme](https://cookingwithjanica.com/homemade-crunchwrap-supreme-recipe/#tasty-recipes-6859) (2)

![first attempt at mock crunchwrap supremes](/food/foodventures/images/mock-crunchwrap-supremes.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

3 servings

<!-- ff -->
- 230 g ground beef *
- 1 Tbsp taco seasoning (half a packet)
- 3 large [tortillas](https://powerhungry.com/2018/05/1-ingredient-red-lentil-tortillas-grain-free-vegan/) *
- 3 tostada shells *
- 1/2 cup sour cream *
- 1 cup shredded lettuce
- 1/2 diced tomato
- 1/2 cup shredded cheese (optional) *
- 1/4 cup [nacho cheese](https://www.budgetbytes.com/5-minute-nacho-cheese-sauce/) *

1. In a skillet or large cooking pan, cook and crumble the ground beef over medium-high heat. When it is no longer pink, drain the grease.
1. Place meat back into the pan and stir the taco seasoning mix as well as the water it calls for on the packet. Cook according to the package instructions.
1. Warm up the nacho cheese sauce in the microwave and set aside.
1. Place the flour tortillas on a plate and warm in the microwave for about 20 seconds.
1. Lay one tortilla on a flat surface. Spread a couple of tablespoons of nacho cheese in the middle of the tortilla.
1. Place ½ cup of taco meat on top of the nacho cheese.
1. Next, add the tostada shell, a thin layer of sour cream, lettuce, tomato, and lastly, the shredded Mexican cheese.
1. To fold into the actual crunchwrap, start with the bottom of the tortilla and fold the edge up to the center of the fillings. Keep doing that, folding as tight as possible, as you work your way around the tortilla.
1. Spray another skillet or cooking pan with cooking spray and heat over medium heat. Place the crunchwrap supreme, seam-side down, onto the skillet. Cook for 2-3 min., or until golden brown.
1. Flip over and cook the other side for another 2-3 min or until golden brown.
1. Cook the rest of your crunchwraps and eat immediately.

## Day 2

<!-- ff -->

Leftovers in the fridge:

- 1 serving Crunchwrap Supreme from Day 1

### Veggie Lunch: [Sweet Potato Bread](https://www.bakefromscratch.com/sweet-potato-dutch-oven-bread/) (4)

1 small loaf (about 6 slices)

<!-- ff -->

- 4 cups (250 g) bread flour
- 3/4 cup (200 g) mashed sweet potato
- 1/2 Tbsp (5 g) kosher salt
- 4 g instant yeast
- 150 g warm water
- Corn flour, for dusting

1. Wash sweet potatoes, prick with a fork, and bake in a 425°F (220°C) oven for 30 to 40 minutes.
1. In a large bowl, place bread flour, sweet potato, salt, yeast, and warm water, and stir by hand until fully incorporated and a sticky dough forms. (Alternatively, place bread flour, sweet potato, salt, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add 1¼ cups [284 grams] warm water, and beat at medium speed until a sticky dough forms, about 30 seconds.)
1. Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place (75°F/24°C) for 2 hours. Then, refrigerate for at least 2 hours (preferably overnight).
1. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface, and gently press dough just to level and even it out. Starting on left side and working clockwise, fold edges of dough toward center, pressing lightly. Turn dough ball over, and using both hands, cup dough, and pull it toward you. Turn dough 90 degrees, and repeat until you have a smooth, tight, sealed round. (See Shape Your Boule on page 46.)
1. Heavily dust a sheet of parchment paper with corn flour; place dough on parchment, seam side up. Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place (75°F/24°C) for 1 hour.
1. When dough has 30 minutes left to rise, place a 6- to 7-quart Dutch oven and lid in a cold oven. Preheat oven to 500°F (260°C).
1. Carefully remove hot Dutch oven from oven, remove lid, and quickly turn bread into Dutch oven so seam is now on bottom. Score top of bread (being careful not to touch hot sides of Dutch oven). Cover with lid, and place back in oven.
1. Immediately reduce oven temperature to 450°F (230°C). Bake for 25 minutes. Remove lid, and bake until an instant-read thermometer inserted in center registers 190°F (88°C), 10 to 15 minutes more. Immediately remove loaf from Dutch oven, and let cool completely on a wire rack.

### Veggie Lunch: Sweet Potato Bread (2)

with some [Laughing Cow cheese and honey](https://www.reddit.com/r/1200isplenty/comments/af7zy2/i_was_really_craving_a_danish_and_toast_with/)

### Meat Dinner: [Beef Stroganoff](https://www.wellplated.com/instant-pot-beef-stroganoff/#wprm-recipe-container-32742) (5)

6 servings

<!-- ff -->
- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil *
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter *
- 1 small yellow or white onion, diced *
- 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided
- 1 1/2 pounds boneless sirloin steak, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes *
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon dried dillweed
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
- 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 3 cups reduced sodium beef broth — divided
- 16 ounces sliced baby Bella cremini mushrooms (optional) *
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour *
- 12 ounces whole wheat wide egg noodles *
- 1 cup plain whole milk Greek yogurt *
- Chopped fresh parsley or thyme (optional)

1. Set Instant Pot to SAUTE. Add the oil and butter. Once hot, add the onion and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring often, until the onion begins to soften but does not brown, 3 to 4 minutes.
1. Sprinkle the beef with remaining 1 teaspoon salt and pepper. (You can toss the beef cubes together with salt pepper in a bowl, or to save a dish I like to do this right on the cutting board.) Add to the pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is browned on all sides, about 4 to 6 minutes. Add the dillweed, garlic powder, onion powder, Worcestershire sauce, and mustard. Pour in 1/2 cup of the beef broth. Stir, scraping a wooden spoon or spatula along the bottom of the pot, to ensure you remove any stuck on bits of food (this will avoid a “burn” warning).
1. Stir in the mushrooms, then sprinkle the flour over the top. Stir until evenly incorporated. Pour in the remaining beef broth. Close and seal the lid. Cook on HIGH pressure (Manual) for 10 minutes. When the time is up, immediately vent the Instant Pot to quick release the pressure.
1. Once you can safely open the pressure cooker, carefully open the lid and add the egg noodles. Recover the Instant Pot, seal, and cook on HIGH (manual) for 5 minutes. When the time is up, allow the pressure to naturally release for 5 minutes, then immediately vent to release any remaining pressure.
1. Carefully open the lid and stir. Let the stroganoff cool for a few minutes, then stir in the Greek yogurt. Serve hot, sprinkled with fresh parsley and/or thyme.

### Meat Dinner:

### Veggie Dinner: Sinigang (3)

> Recipe credit: [MC Baker from Genius Kitchen](https://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/vegetarian-sinigang-filipino-tamarind-or-sour-soup-313263)  
> 4 servings

<!-- ff -->
* 400 g canned diced tomatoes or 3 peeled chopped tomatoes, with their juice *
* 1 large potato or 3 small potatoes, diced to 1 inch cubes *
* 1 large bok choy or Chinese cabbage *
* 1 cup fresh green beans
* 450 g tofu
* 1 chayote or zucchini
* 1 medium onion
* 4 garlic cloves or 4 tsp minced garlic
* 2 sour tamarind pods or 2 two sweet tamarind pods and juice of one limes
* salt
* pepper
* 6 cups (1400 mL) water or stock (approximate, adjust this to your liking)

1. Chop all vegetables and tofu into 1 inch pieces. Dice onion finely. If you use chayote, just cut it in half from where the dip is. It's similar to a mango with the shape of the pit being flat, but the pit is soft unlike in a mango so there's no need to cut around it. Remove the pit/seed from the two halves. Dice, peeling is not necessary.
1. If you're using tamarind remove the hard outer shell. The insides feel and sometimes smell like the insides of raisins or prunes. If the tamarind tastes sweet it's not going to give you the right flavor for the soup, but can still be close with kalamansi or lemon juice added. It should be a sour taste. Soak the tamarind pulp, seeds and all, in 1 cup of warm water. Mash this with a fork to remove most of the tamarind from the seeds. Fish out the seeds and the membranes and reserve the liquid to add after potatoes are cooked.
1. Cook potatoes in water with a touch of salt for about 10 minutes, or until almost cooked through.
1. Add remaining veggies and seasoning and cook 10-15 minutes more, or until veggies are cooked to desired consistency.
1. Taste broth and adjust water and tamarind seasoning and salt to your liking. Keep in mind that if you're serving this with rice, as I always do, you probably want more intense flavors and a more stew like consistency.

### Dessert: New York Cheesecake (4)

> Recipe credit: [Pressure Cook Recipes](https://www.pressurecookrecipes.com/instant-pot-cheesecake-new-york/)
> 6 servings (slices)

<!-- ff -->
- 120 g graham crackers, finely ground *
- 42–56 g unsalted butter, melted *
- sea salt
- 8.3 brown sugar (adjust to taste) *
- 32 g all-purpose flour *
- 454 g cream cheese, room temperature *
- 2 large eggs, room temperature *
- 100 g white sugar *
- 120 g sour cream, room temperature *
- 16 g cornstarch
- 10 mL vanilla extract

1. Finely ground 120g graham crackers in a food processor. Or place the graham crackers in a Ziploc bag and roll them with a rolling pin.
1. Mix Crust Mixture: In a small mixing bowl, mix finely ground graham crackers, a pinch of sea salt, all purpose flour, and brown sugar together with a fork.
1. Mix in melted butter until the mixture sticks together.
1. Line the side & bottom of cheesecake pan with parchment paper.
1. Pour in the graham cracker crumbs mixture. Gently press down the crumbs with a ramekin or Mason jar to form an even layer. You can also use a spoon for the edges.
1. Blind-Bake (for firmer & crisper crust): Place crust in a 325°F oven for 15 minutes.
1. Mix cornstarch, 2 pinches of sea salt, and white sugar together in a small mixing bowl.
1. In a medium mixing bowl, briefly break up the 454g cream cheese by beating it for 10 seconds with a hand mixer using low speed.
1. Add in half the sugar mixture and beat until just incorporated using low speed (roughly 20 - 30 seconds). Scrape down the sides and hand mixer with a silicone spatula every time a new ingredient is added. Add remaining sugar mixture and beat until just incorporated using low speed (roughly 20 - 30 seconds).
1. Add sour cream and vanilla extract to the cream cheese mixture. Beat until just incorporated using low speed (20 - 30 seconds).
1. Blend in the two eggs using low speed, one at a time. Mix until just incorporated (about 15 – 20 seconds with a hand mixer & less time if you are using a powerful stand mixer). Try not to overmix on this step. Scrape down the sides and hand mixer with a silicone spatula and fold a few times to make sure everything is fully incorporated.
1. Pour cream cheese batter in cheesecake pan. Tap cheesecake pan against the counter to let air bubbles rise to the surface. Burst the air bubbles with a toothpick or fork. Tap until you are satisfied. Ensure the surface is clear of air bubbles or fork marks.
1. Pour 1 cup (250 ml) of cold water in pressure cooker. Place cheesecake pan on top of a steamer rack (so, it’s not touching the water). Close lid and pressure cook at High Pressure for 26 minutes and Full Natural Release. Natural release will take roughly 7 minutes. Open lid gradually. Absorb any condensation on surface by lightly tapping it with a soft paper towel.
1. Allow cheesecake to cool to room temperature with the lid open in the pressure cooker. Or place it on a wire rack to cool to room temperature.
1. Release Cheesecake from Sidewall to Avoid Cracking: After cooling for 10 – 15 minutes, carefully run a thin paring knife between the sidewall and parchment paper to release the cheesecake from the pan. Pull the slightly wrinkled parchment paper lightly to straighten it out for a smooth side.
1. Once the cheesecake has completely cooled, place it in the refrigerator for at least 4 – 8 hours (preferably overnight).
1. Remove cheesecake from the refrigerator. The best way to release the cheesecake from the bottom pan is warm the bottom of the pan to melt the butter. You can use a torch or heating pad for this step. Carefully peel off the parchment paper. Enjoy~
