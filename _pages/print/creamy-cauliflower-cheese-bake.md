*{{page.excerpt}}*

## Ingredients:

- 1 medium head or 550 g of cauliflower
- 25 g butter (about 2 tbsp)
- 10 g flour (about 2 tbsp)
- 150 mL milk
- 1 cup or 113 g of roughly chopped cheese (I used marbled cheddar)

## Instructions:

1. Steam cauliflower until almost fall-apart tender. I used my Instant Pot's STEAM function (5 min @ high).
1. While you let the cauliflower cool, add butter and flour to a medium saucepan on medium heat and whisk together.
1. When thoroughly mixed, add milk and turn heat down to low. Whisk frequently until sauce thickens.
1. Stir in two-thirds of the cheese and turn off heat.
1. When cauliflower is cool enough to handle, break into small florets and add to saucepan. Stir, coating all the florets.
1. Pour into a small glass casserole dish (or foil-lined baking pan) and sprinkle remaining cheese on top.
1. Bake at 375° F on the second-to-top rack for 25–30 minutes, or until golden on top.
