*{{page.excerpt}}*

## Ingredients:

- 60 g butter or ghee (about 1/2 cup)
- 1 heaping cup besan aka chickpea flour
- 5 whole cardamom pods, blended into powder in a high-speed blender, or 1/4 tsp cardamom powder
- 1 cup powdered sugar (or less if you prefer)

## Instructions:

1. Melt butter or ghee in a small saucepan on medium heat.
1. Add chickpea flour and mix evenly with a spatula or wooden spoon to form a crumbly mixture.
1. Stir continuously until butter starts to come out of the mixture, creating a paste that resembles thick peanut butter. (You may want to turn heat to medium-low at this point, so you can be lazier and stir less often while reducing the chance of burning  it.) This step takes a looong time so don't get impatient or give up hope! Your first sign that the mixture is almost there is when it starts getting darker in places.
1. Turn off the heat and mix in the powdered sugar and cardamom.
1. When it has cooled enough to handle, take handfuls of the mixture and roll with your palms into ping pong-sized balls. Place on a piece of plastic wrap or parchment paper and let it cool before enjoying (optional).
