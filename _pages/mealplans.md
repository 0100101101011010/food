> Recipe credit: [Cooking with Janica](https://cookingwithjanica.com/homemade-crunchwrap-supreme-recipe/#tasty-recipes-6859), [Power Hungry](https://powerhungry.com/2018/05/1-ingredient-red-lentil-tortillas-grain-free-vegan/), and [Budget Bytes](https://www.budgetbytes.com/5-minute-nacho-cheese-sauce/)  
> 3 servings

- 230 g ground beef *
- 1 Tbsp taco seasoning (half a packet)
- 3 large [tortillas](https://powerhungry.com/2018/05/1-ingredient-red-lentil-tortillas-grain-free-vegan/) *
- 3 tostada shells *
- 1/2 cup sour cream *
- 1 cup shredded lettuce
- 1/2 diced tomato
- 1/2 cup shredded cheese (optional) *
- 1/4 cup [nacho cheese](https://www.budgetbytes.com/5-minute-nacho-cheese-sauce/) *

1. In a skillet or large cooking pan, cook and crumble the ground beef over medium-high heat. When it is no longer pink, drain the grease.
1. Place meat back into the pan and stir the taco seasoning mix as well as the water it calls for on the packet. Cook according to the package instructions.
1. Warm up the nacho cheese sauce in the microwave and set aside.
1. Place the flour tortillas on a plate and warm in the microwave for about 20 seconds.
1. Lay one tortilla on a flat surface. Spread a couple of tablespoons of nacho cheese in the middle of the tortilla.
1. Place ½ cup of taco meat on top of the nacho cheese.
1. Next, add the tostada shell, a thin layer of sour cream, lettuce, tomato, and lastly, the shredded Mexican cheese.
1. To fold into the actual crunchwrap, start with the bottom of the tortilla and fold the edge up to the center of the fillings. Keep doing that, folding as tight as possible, as you work your way around the tortilla.
1. Spray another skillet or cooking pan with cooking spray and heat over medium heat. Place the crunchwrap supreme, seam-side down, onto the skillet. Cook for 2-3 min., or until golden brown.
1. Flip over and cook the other side for another 2-3 min or until golden brown.
1. Cook the rest of your crunchwraps and eat immediately.

## Day 2

### Snack: Sweet Potato Bread

> Recipe credit: [Bake from Scratch](https://www.bakefromscratch.com/sweet-potato-dutch-oven-bread/)  
> 1 small loaf (about 6 slices)

- 4 cups (250 g) bread flour
- 3/4 cup (200 g) mashed sweet potato
- 1/2 Tbsp (5 g) kosher salt
- 4 g instant yeast
- 150 g warm water
- Corn flour, for dusting

1. Wash sweet potatoes, prick with a fork, and bake in a 425°F (220°C) oven for 30 to 40 minutes.
1. In a large bowl, place bread flour, sweet potato, salt, yeast, and warm water, and stir by hand until fully incorporated and a sticky dough forms. (Alternatively, place bread flour, sweet potato, salt, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add 1¼ cups [284 grams] warm water, and beat at medium speed until a sticky dough forms, about 30 seconds.)
1. Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place (75°F/24°C) for 2 hours. Then, refrigerate for at least 2 hours (preferably overnight).
1. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface, and gently press dough just to level and even it out. Starting on left side and working clockwise, fold edges of dough toward center, pressing lightly. Turn dough ball over, and using both hands, cup dough, and pull it toward you. Turn dough 90 degrees, and repeat until you have a smooth, tight, sealed round. (See Shape Your Boule on page 46.)
1. Heavily dust a sheet of parchment paper with corn flour; place dough on parchment, seam side up. Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place (75°F/24°C) for 1 hour.
1. When dough has 30 minutes left to rise, place a 6- to 7-quart Dutch oven and lid in a cold oven. Preheat oven to 500°F (260°C).
1. Carefully remove hot Dutch oven from oven, remove lid, and quickly turn bread into Dutch oven so seam is now on bottom. Score top of bread (being careful not to touch hot sides of Dutch oven). Cover with lid, and place back in oven.
1. Immediately reduce oven temperature to 450°F (230°C). Bake for 25 minutes. Remove lid, and bake until an instant-read thermometer inserted in center registers 190°F (88°C), 10 to 15 minutes more. Immediately remove loaf from Dutch oven, and let cool completely on a wire rack.

### Meat Dinner: Beef Stroganoff

> Recipe credit: [Well Plated](https://www.wellplated.com/instant-pot-beef-stroganoff/#wprm-recipe-container-32742)  
> 6 servings

#### Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil *
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter *
- 1 small yellow or white onion, diced *
- 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided
- 1 1/2 pounds boneless sirloin steak, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes *
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon dried dillweed
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
- 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 3 cups reduced sodium beef broth — divided
- 16 ounces sliced baby Bella cremini mushrooms (optional) *
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour *
- 12 ounces whole wheat wide egg noodles *
- 1 cup plain whole milk Greek yogurt *
- Chopped fresh parsley or thyme (optional)

#### Instructions

1. Set Instant Pot to SAUTE. Add the oil and butter. Once hot, add the onion and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring often, until the onion begins to soften but does not brown, 3 to 4 minutes.
1. Sprinkle the beef with remaining 1 teaspoon salt and pepper. (You can toss the beef cubes together with salt pepper in a bowl, or to save a dish I like to do this right on the cutting board.) Add to the pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is browned on all sides, about 4 to 6 minutes. Add the dillweed, garlic powder, onion powder, Worcestershire sauce, and mustard. Pour in 1/2 cup of the beef broth. Stir, scraping a wooden spoon or spatula along the bottom of the pot, to ensure you remove any stuck on bits of food (this will avoid a “burn” warning).
1. Stir in the mushrooms, then sprinkle the flour over the top. Stir until evenly incorporated. Pour in the remaining beef broth. Close and seal the lid. Cook on HIGH pressure (Manual) for 10 minutes. When the time is up, immediately vent the Instant Pot to quick release the pressure.
1. Once you can safely open the pressure cooker, carefully open the lid and add the egg noodles. Recover the Instant Pot, seal, and cook on HIGH (manual) for 5 minutes. When the time is up, allow the pressure to naturally release for 5 minutes, then immediately vent to release any remaining pressure.
1. Carefully open the lid and stir. Let the stroganoff cool for a few minutes, then stir in the Greek yogurt. Serve hot, sprinkled with fresh parsley and/or thyme.
