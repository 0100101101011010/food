![first attempt at mock crunchwrap supremes](/food/foodventures/images/mock-crunchwrap-supremes.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

> Recipe credit: [Cooking with Janica](https://cookingwithjanica.com/homemade-crunchwrap-supreme-recipe/#tasty-recipes-6859), [Power Hungry](https://powerhungry.com/2018/05/1-ingredient-red-lentil-tortillas-grain-free-vegan/), and [Budget Bytes](https://www.budgetbytes.com/5-minute-nacho-cheese-sauce/)
> 3 servings

#### Ingredients

- 230 g ground beef *
- 1 Tbsp taco seasoning (half a packet)
- 3 large [tortillas](https://powerhungry.com/2018/05/1-ingredient-red-lentil-tortillas-grain-free-vegan/) *
- 3 tostada shells *
- 1/2 cup sour cream *
- 1 cup shredded lettuce
- 1/2 diced tomato
- 1/2 cup shredded cheese (optional) *
- 1/4 cup [nacho cheese](https://www.budgetbytes.com/5-minute-nacho-cheese-sauce/) *

#### Instructions

1. In a skillet or large cooking pan, cook and crumble the ground beef over medium-high heat. When it is no longer pink, drain the grease.
1. Place meat back into the pan and stir the taco seasoning mix as well as the water it calls for on the packet. Cook according to the package instructions.
1. Warm up the nacho cheese sauce in the microwave and set aside.
1. Place the flour tortillas on a plate and warm in the microwave for about 20 seconds.
1. Lay one tortilla on a flat surface. Spread a couple of tablespoons of nacho cheese in the middle of the tortilla.
1. Place ½ cup of taco meat on top of the nacho cheese.
1. Next, add the tostada shell, a thin layer of sour cream, lettuce, tomato, and lastly, the shredded Mexican cheese.
1. To fold into the actual crunchwrap, start with the bottom of the tortilla and fold the edge up to the center of the fillings. Keep doing that, folding as tight as possible, as you work your way around the tortilla.
1. Spray another skillet or cooking pan with cooking spray and heat over medium heat. Place the crunchwrap supreme, seam-side down, onto the skillet. Cook for 2-3 min., or until golden brown.
1. Flip over and cook the other side for another 2-3 min or until golden brown.
1. Cook the rest of your crunchwraps and eat immediately.

## Day 2

### Meat Dinner: Beef Stroganoff

> Recipe credit: [Well Plated](https://www.wellplated.com/instant-pot-beef-stroganoff/#wprm-recipe-container-32742)
> 6 servings

#### Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1 small yellow or white onion — diced
- 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt — divided
- 1 1/2 pounds boneless sirloin steak — cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon dried dillweed
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
- 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 3 cups reduced sodium beef broth — divided
- 16 ounces sliced baby Bella cremini mushrooms (optional)
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 12 ounces whole wheat wide egg noodles
- 1 cup plain whole milk Greek yogurt — do not use nonfat or it will curdle
- Chopped fresh parsley or thyme (optional)

#### Instructions

1. Set Instant Pot to SAUTE. Add the oil and butter. Once hot, add the onion and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring often, until the onion begins to soften but does not brown, 3 to 4 minutes.
1. Sprinkle the beef with remaining 1 teaspoon salt and pepper. (You can toss the beef cubes together with salt pepper in a bowl, or to save a dish I like to do this right on the cutting board.) Add to the pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is browned on all sides, about 4 to 6 minutes. Add the dillweed, garlic powder, onion powder, Worcestershire sauce, and mustard. Pour in 1/2 cup of the beef broth. Stir, scraping a wooden spoon or spatula along the bottom of the pot, to ensure you remove any stuck on bits of food (this will avoid a “burn” warning).
1. Stir in the mushrooms, then sprinkle the flour over the top. Stir until evenly incorporated. Pour in the remaining beef broth. Close and seal the lid. Cook on HIGH pressure (Manual) for 10 minutes. When the time is up, immediately vent the Instant Pot to quick release the pressure.
1. Once you can safely open the pressure cooker, carefully open the lid and add the egg noodles. Recover the Instant Pot, seal, and cook on HIGH (manual) for 5 minutes. When the time is up, allow the pressure to naturally release for 5 minutes, then immediately vent to release any remaining pressure.
1. Carefully open the lid and stir. Let the stroganoff cool for a few minutes, then stir in the Greek yogurt. Serve hot, sprinkled with fresh parsley and/or thyme.

### Veggie Dinner: Cabbage and Peas Curry

3 servings

#### Ingredients

1. Add chopped tomato and spices.  Mix well.
1. Add chopped cabbage and green peas. Stir well so the spices mix with the cabbage. Make sure nothing is stuck to the bottom of the pot. If there is, add 2-3 tbsp of water, and deglaze the pot.
1. Close the instant pot lid with vent in sealing position. Change the instant pot setting to manual or pressure cook mode at low pressure for 2 minutes.  
1. When the instant pot beeps, quick release the pressure manually.  Stir the cabbage.  
(optional) Add the dry mango powder and mix it with the cabbage.  If there is any liquid, you can dry it by sauteing for 2 minutes.  
1. Enjoy Cabbage & Peas Stir Fry with roti and yogurt.
