</p>
</details>

##### Instructions

1. In a skillet or large cooking pan, cook and crumble the ground beef over medium-high heat. When it is no longer pink, drain the grease.
1. Place meat back into the pan and stir the taco seasoning mix as well as the water it calls for on the packet. Cook according to the package instructions.
1. Warm up the nacho cheese sauce in the microwave and set aside.
1. Place the flour tortillas on a plate and warm in the microwave for about 20 seconds.
1. Lay one tortilla on a flat surface. Spread a couple of tablespoons of nacho cheese in the middle of the tortilla.
1. Place ½ cup of taco meat on top of the nacho cheese.
1. Next, add the tostada shell, a thin layer of sour cream, lettuce, tomato, and lastly, the shredded Mexican cheese.
1. To fold into the actual crunchwrap, start with the bottom of the tortilla and fold the edge up to the center of the fillings. Keep doing that, folding as tight as possible, as you work your way around the tortilla.
1. Spray another skillet or cooking pan with cooking spray and heat over medium heat. Place the crunchwrap supreme, seam-side down, onto the skillet. Cook for 2-3 min., or until golden brown.
1. Flip over and cook the other side for another 2-3 min or until golden brown.
1. Cook the rest of your crunchwraps and eat immediately.

Recipe credit: [Buns In My Oven](https://www.bunsinmyoven.com/low-carb-bacon-cheeseburger-casserole/)

4 servings

##### Ingredients

- 150 g bacon *
- 230 g ground beef *
- 1/2 small onion *
- 1 clove garlic or 1 scant tsp minced garlic
- 2.5 Tbsp cream cheese *
- 1.5 Tbsp ketchup
- 1 scant Tbsp yellow mustard
- 1 scant Tbsp worcestershire sauce
- 1 scant tsp salt
- 2 large eggs or 3 small ones *
- 2.5 Tbsp heavy cream *
- 1 tsp ground black pepper
- 1 tsp hot sauce (adjust to taste)
- 340 g cheddar cheese, shredded *
- 1 tsp fresh dill

##### Instructions

1. Dice the bacon into small pieces and place in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring often, until crisp. Remove bacon from pan and set aside. Drain grease from pan.
1. Add the ground beef to the skillet and cook until browned, crumbling as it cooks. Drain fat.
1. Add the onion and garlic to the skillet with the beef and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.
1. Add the cream cheese, ketchup, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and seasoned salt to the skillet and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until combined.
1. Spread the beef mixture into a greased 8x8 baking dish. Top with the cooked bacon.
1. Crack the eggs into a medium bowl and whisk together with the heavy cream until combined. Stir in the pepper and hot sauce.
1. Pour the egg mixture over the beef and bacon.
1. Top with the cheddar cheese.
1. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until set and golden on top. Sprinkle with dill before serving.

### Day 2

#### Dinner: Beef Stroganoff

##### Instructions

1. Set Instant Pot to SAUTE. Add the oil and butter. Once hot, add the onion and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring often, until the onion begins to soften but does not brown, 3 to 4 minutes.
1. Sprinkle the beef with remaining 1 teaspoon salt and pepper. (You can toss the beef cubes together with salt pepper in a bowl, or to save a dish I like to do this right on the cutting board.) Add to the pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is browned on all sides, about 4 to 6 minutes. Add the dillweed, garlic powder, onion powder, Worcestershire sauce, and mustard. Pour in 1/2 cup of the beef broth. Stir, scraping a wooden spoon or spatula along the bottom of the pot, to ensure you remove any stuck on bits of food (this will avoid a “burn” warning).
1. Stir in the mushrooms, then sprinkle the flour over the top. Stir until evenly incorporated. Pour in the remaining beef broth. Close and seal the lid. Cook on HIGH pressure (Manual) for 10 minutes. When the time is up, immediately vent the Instant Pot to quick release the pressure.
1. Once you can safely open the pressure cooker, carefully open the lid and add the egg noodles. Recover the Instant Pot, seal, and cook on HIGH (manual) for 5 minutes. When the time is up, allow the pressure to naturally release for 5 minutes, then immediately vent to release any remaining pressure.
1. Carefully open the lid and stir. Let the stroganoff cool for a few minutes, then stir in the Greek yogurt. Serve hot, sprinkled with fresh parsley and/or thyme
