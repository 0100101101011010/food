Now that I've got an access card for the office, I can start bringing microwaveable food to reheat at lunchtime without fear of getting locked out! I really put effort into meal prepping most of my meals this week to save time.

# Monday: Savoury Lentil Soup and Avocado Melt

![lentil soup at the office](/food/images/recipe-savoury-lentil-soup-slow-cooker-instant-pot-3.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-right}

I technically started this recipe on Sunday, because it's a slow cooker recipe and I wanted it to be ready for packing into my lunch on Monday morning. It's my own concoction and it tastes AMAZING! I'm so happy and surprised that throwing vegetables and water in a pot overnight turned out so well, but it makes sense since carrots, celery, and onions are the base of any vegetable stock, and this soup has them all.

This was a snack after work because I was feeling hungry. Clearly that little lunch container of lentil soup wasn't enough to keep me full for the rest of the day.

There are a lot of avocado toast and avocado sandwiches out there, but can you believe this is the first time I've ever put avocado on bread? My family eats them without preparation, like straight up cut one in half and eat with a spoon, and that's how I've always eaten them too. But seeing all the gorgeous Instagram photos of avocado toast finally made me curious enough to try, so I threw this together after browsing a few recipes for inspiration.

Now this was REALLY GOOD for someone who was starving, but I don't think I would make it again. Heated-up avocado has kind of a weird taste to me, I don't know if it was something about this method in particular where it was mixing with the melted cheese or what, but I've learned I prefer my avocados R A W. Still, all that carby fatty goodness was satisfying and I enjoyed it!

## Tuesday: Polvorones

The first time I made polvorones, I accidentally used too much butter and they were the most shapeless, greasiest cookies I've ever handled. My boyfriend also said they were the best cookies he'd ever tasted. Encouraged by this, I tried again, with the correct amount of butter but made the mistake of not sifting whole wheat flour...! And the difference in texture was very obvious.

So this time, I was very careful, followed the recipe directions to the letter, and... they still turned out meh. Why? Because I had substituted Crisco for the butter.

My boyfriend gets mad that I always seem to be making substitutions for this and that, usually in an effort to make my baking healthier. But honestly, nutrition wasn't even on my mind when I made this, I mean, I didn't have butter on hand, and both Crisco and butter were fats anyway, right? :-( I should've learned from my mistake last week when I attempted those [sugar cookies](/food/foodventures/what-i-ate-starring-wafflemaker/).

In addition to some of the cookies flattening out rather than retaining their ball shape, these polvorones just had no delicious buttery flavour. They tasted very flat. I guess the aroma of butter is something you can't easily replace with just any fat.

## Wednesday: Savoury Overnight Oats Failure

I'd been eating sweet overnight oats for the past week and wanted to switch things up a bit. So using my usual habit, I scrolled through a few different recipes online and tried the easiest one. Halfway through, I derailed from the recipe and decided to make a few of my own spice decisions, like adding some curry powder because I love curry and parsley because it looked nice.

The result was absolutely inedible. As soon as I took my first taste, after sitting down at my desk, I almost gagged with how bad it was. Figured it could be an acquired taste so I kept forcing down several more mouthfuls, each one was literally so bad. I had to throw it away after somehow finishing a third of it, and I'm surprised I got that far.

NOTE TO SELF: NEVER TRUST YOURSELF TO MAKE EXECUTIVE RECIPE DECISIONS AGAIN

## Thursday: Brownie Batter Chocolate Overnight Oats

I had to get the taste from yesterday's oats out of my mouth so I tried a [recipe from Chocolate Covered Katie](https://chocolatecoveredkatie.com/2016/04/07/chocolate-overnight-oats-brownie-batter/comment-page-2/), who has so far never let me down. Notice the present tense, because these were SO GOOD!!! I used honey to sweeten it and tasted as I went until it was just barely sweet enough. Somehow it hits the perfect middle between tasting healthy and tasting like dessert. I could see myself eating this often in the future!
