## An Exercise in Cooking with Half Your Pantry Missing

This week's theme, I guess, is making do with some random assortment of ingredients while you are missing half your kitchen essentials. I've been relying heavily on baked goods and stuff I can cook in my Instant Pot (when am I not?) because my pots and pans are back in Waterloo at the moment.

## Monday: Egg waffles

![egg waffles](/food/images/foodventures-egg-waffles.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-left}

My new Blendtec jar came in today! The first things I made with it were these egg waffles. I've seen a recipe for this floating around, but since I was so eager to break in the blender jar I just went ahead and tried to engineer my own waffles without thinking about it first. My wafflemaker has handled some pretty weird things I've thrown at it, so I figured eggs should be no different, right?

I preheated my waffle iron, cracked a few eggs into the Blendtec, added half a bell pepper and half an onion, some salt and pepper, and blended it on the lowest speed setting until everything looked fairly pureed.

Maybe not surprisingly, it didn't turn out as well as I imagined. The first two waffles I dropped into the iron came out very thin and was hard to get off the iron in one piece. Because the mixture was so runny, it couldn't form anything substantial. So then I added some flour... and some more for good measure.

And that's how I got to the waffles in the picture. They definitely look pretty, and I have to say I got the timing down perfectly! However, the flavour was pretty disappointing. I was hoping for something like a cross between fried and scrambled eggs, you know, crispy on the outside and soft inside, with a decidedly eggy taste... The extra flour I added made these pretty bland, and kinda... bouncy. Also, I didn't add enough salt.

## Tuesday: Swedish Sugar Cookies

Since, as mentioned, I'm short on ingredients this week, I tried out a very basic cookie recipe that doesn't need much beyond your barest baking essentials. According to the [Taste of Home](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/sugar-cookies/) recipe page, these cookies originate from Sweden in the 1800's. With such a long past, you'd expect the recipe to have been perfected throughout the generations to become foolproof. Sadly these were some of the most disappointing cookies I've ever made.

![swedish sugar cookies](/food/images/foodventures-swedish-sugar-cookies-2.jpg){:width="50%"}{: .image-left}

Even just by looking at them, they seem pretty boring, don't they?

I have to say this isn't necessarily the fault of the recipe, since I didn't follow it exactly. I didn't have butter on hand, so I substituted shortening. And I hadn't brought over my giant box of baking soda, so I used baking powder only. Minor changes, or so I thought, but it ended up having a big impact on the finished product.

Also, it's my first time using the oven in my new apartment, and I think it may be hotter than most ovens. The bottoms of my cookies were almost burned when I pulled them out at the 10-minute mark, which is the shorter end of the recommended baking time listed in the recipe.

Eating one of these was basically just biting into something crunchy with absolutely no flavour profile beyond "sweet." I felt pretty sad because the batch I made ended up yielding a lot of cookies (what is pictured is probably 1/4 of the whole thing), and I really didn't look forward to eating them. So I've frozen the rest and... currently dreading about finishing them.

That said, I've learned a lot of lessons from this one failure, like

1. butter and shortening cannot be used interchangeable
1. lower the temperature of the oven by 10-ish degrees
1. don't make a big batch if you aren't sure you'll like it

so it hasn't been a complete waste!

## Wednesday: Tuna Cottage Cheese "Salad"

This recipe is from [Maybe I Will](https://maybeiwill.com/3-healthy-tuna-recipes-that-will-rock/). It's meant to be a dip, but since I didn't have crackers, I just ate it on its own. It was okay, but I added way more pepper than called for and it was still pretty tasteless. I was hoping it would turn out more like a classic tuna salad taste, but I guess you can't really replace mayo with cottage cheese!

## Thursday: Egg Waffles Again (With More Success)

![egg waffles, second attempt](/food/images/foodventures-egg-waffles-2.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-left}

So I tried making egg waffles again, this time using a [recipe](https://thecozycook.com/waffle-iron-omelette/) (skipping the cheese). So I did have more success this round, and the texture was on point, but the taste was still not quite there. When I eat eggs I want something that's really savoury and filling. This doesn't exactly hit the spot, but it's not bad! I think I will keep experimenting with making these until I find the perfect formula, since the idea of waffle-shaped eggs remains super appealing to me.

I might try [this recipe](https://www.groundedandsurrounded.com/recipe/scrambled-egg-waffles/) next; it seems even simpler than the one I've just tried, so maybe if I can get the basics down using this technique I can then move on to adding in more veggies and stuff.

## Friday: Tea Eggs, Seitan Steak and Peanut Butter Cookies

I actually started making these on Thursday. (I know, I don't blame you for thinking _how many eggs does this girl eat and is it healthy?!_ But I bought an 18-count carton of eggs this week so I have quite a lot to play with, and luckily I'm a fan of eggs in basically any form. I made ten of these eggs using this recipe and plan to eat one or two a day.)

![tea eggs](/food/images/foodventures-tea-eggs.jpg){:width="40%"}{: .image-left}

When I was a kid, my mom would make these tea eggs a few times a year and I always DEVOURED them. And since it's a pretty simple matter of boiling eggs and marinating them, I decided it was time I started making them myself. On the way to Toronto from Calgary after winter break, I brought with me a pack of old loose leaf black tea, which are essential for this recipe.
