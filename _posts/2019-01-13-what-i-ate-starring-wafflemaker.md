## An Exercise in Cooking with Half Your Pantry Missing

This week's theme, I guess, is making do with some random assortment of ingredients while you are missing half your kitchen essentials. I've been relying heavily on baked goods and stuff I can cook in my Instant Pot (when am I not?) because my pots and pans are back in Waterloo at the moment.

## Monday: Egg waffles

My new Blendtec jar came in today! The first things I made with it were these egg waffles. I've seen a recipe for this floating around, but since I was so eager to break in the blender jar I just went ahead and tried to engineer my own waffles without thinking about it first. My wafflemaker has handled some pretty weird things I've thrown at it, so I figured eggs should be no different, right?

I preheated my waffle iron, cracked a few eggs into the Blendtec, added half a bell pepper and half an onion, some salt and pepper, and blended it on the lowest speed setting until everything looked fairly pureed.

Maybe not surprisingly, it didn't turn out as well as I imagined. The first two waffles I dropped into the iron came out very thin and was hard to get off the iron in one piece. Because the mixture was so runny, it couldn't form anything substantial. So then I added some flour... and some more for good measure.

And that's how I got to the waffles in the picture. They definitely look pretty, and I have to say I got the timing down perfectly! However, the flavour was pretty disappointing. I was hoping for something like a cross between fried and scrambled eggs, you know, crispy on the outside and soft inside, with a decidedly eggy taste... The extra flour I added made these pretty bland, and kinda... bouncy. Also, I didn't add enough salt.

## Tuesday: Swedish Sugar Cookies

Since, as mentioned, I'm short on ingredients this week, I tried out a very basic cookie recipe that doesn't need much beyond your barest baking essentials. According to the [Taste of Home](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/sugar-cookies/) recipe page, these cookies originate from Sweden in the 1800's. With such a long past, you'd expect the recipe to have been perfected throughout the generations to become foolproof. Sadly these were some of the most disappointing cookies I've ever made.

Even just by looking at them, they seem pretty boring, don't they?

I have to say this isn't necessarily the fault of the recipe, since I didn't follow it exactly. I didn't have butter on hand, so I substituted shortening. And I hadn't brought over my giant box of baking soda, so I used baking powder only. Minor changes, or so I thought, but it ended up having a big impact on the finished product.

Also, it's my first time using the oven in my new apartment, and I think it may be hotter than most ovens. The bottoms of my cookies were almost burned when I pulled them out at the 10-minute mark, which is the shorter end of the recommended baking time listed in the recipe.

Eating one of these was basically just biting into something crunchy with absolutely no flavour profile beyond "sweet." I felt pretty sad because the batch I made ended up yielding a lot of cookies (what is pictured is probably 1/4 of the whole thing), and I really didn't look forward to eating them. So I've frozen most of them and... will probably get around to finishing them off one day.

All in all, even though everything from the taste and texture of these cookies

## Recipe notes

|------------------|------------------------------|
| **ACTIVE TIME**  | 15 min                       |
| **TOTAL TIME**   | 4â€“9 hours                    |
| **SERVINGS**     | 8                            |

| **FRIDGE**       | refrigerate for up to 8 days |
| **FREEZER**      | freeze for several months    |

This recipe is super forgiving and easy to customize! For example, if you want a thicker stew-like meal, just reduce the water by a quarter. You can substitute double the amount of fresh thyme for dried. The spinach can be swapped out for kale or swiss chard or left out altogether.

The first time I made this, I sauteed the onions and garlic in 1 tsp of sesame oil. But having done it with just water since then, I don't think the taste is hugely affected. If you're not counting calories, feel free to add some oil to make it more fragrant!

\* **Vegan:** Use 2 L of vegetable stock instead of water and chicken bouillon.

## Enjoy!

![savoury vegan lentil soup](/food/images/recipe-savoury-lentil-soup-slow-cooker-instant-pot-1.jpg){:width="60%"}{: .image-left}

I can't believe it's February already! Last month, I was settling into my co-op job and trying to get used to real "Adulthood."  Now things have fallen into a kind of routine, although I'm still figuring a lot of things out. Even though I had a lot of fun cooking last term, most importantly I learned that making food takes a lot of time. To be honest, by the end of four months, I was almost a little burned out. So my New Year's resolution for this year is to meal prep more and spend less time in the kitchen.

When it comes to meal prep, my recipes follow three guiding principles:

1. Keeps well in the fridge (and, ideally, the freezer too)
1. Tasty (to curb my urges to eat out)
1. Low effort

I'm very happy to report that this lentil soup is all three!

I'm not into fresh herbs at all... every college student who tries to cook at home knows the struggle of buying a handful of cilantro or parsley for a recipe, only to have to throw away the wilted remainder a week later. There's nothing more stressful than knowing you have produce going bad in your fridge but not having a recipe to use it in. I don't want my life to be run by herbs!! That's why when I come up with recipes, I try to stick to dried spices and herbs. These babies don't go bad for a long time, plus they don't take up space in the fridge.

I also try to make my recipes versatile. This soup is super flexible on the vegetables. You can add in vegetables, like tomatoes, squash, mushrooms, etc. or substitute one for another. It's great for dumping some leftovers in!

This soup is awesome! The first day I brought this to work, I didn't even heat it up in the microwave and just ate it cold at my desk (didn't have access to a microwave back then, long story), and it was still pretty good.

In fact, I had it for breakfast, lunch *and* dinner that day, and had four containers left to spare.
