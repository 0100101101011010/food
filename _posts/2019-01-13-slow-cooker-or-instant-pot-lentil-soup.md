I can't believe it's February already! Last month, I was settling into my co-op job and trying to get used to real "Adulthood."  Now things have fallen into a kind of routine, although I'm still figuring a lot of things out.Even though I had a lot of fun cooking last term, I've really discovered

When it comes to meal prep, my recipes follow three guiding principles.

1. Keeps well in the fridge (and, ideally, the freezer too)
1. Tasty (to curb my urges to eat out)
1. Low effort

I'm very happy to report that this recipe is all three!

I'm not into fresh herbs at all... every college student who tries to cook at home knows the struggle of buying a handful of cilantro or parsley for a recipe, only to have to throw away the wilted remainder a week later. There's nothing more stressful than knowing you have produce going bad in your fridge but not having a recipe to use it in. I don't want my life to be dictated by herbs!! That's why when I come up with recipes, I only use dried spices and herbs. These babies don't go bad for a long time, plus they don't take up space in the fridge.

I also try to make my recipes versatile. When it comes to vegetables, you can also find substitutes between

[Lentil veggie stew](https://weelicious.com/2011/01/02/crock-pot-lentil-veggie-stew/), made in my Instant pot. Instead of olive oil, I used sesame oil (which smells amazing btw), and half a tablespoon of dried thyme instead of fresh. I left out the chopped tomatoes and leeks, since I don't like either of those veggies, and subbed spinach for kale. This soup is awesome! The first day I brought this to work, I didn't even heat it up in the microwave and just ate it cold at my desk (long story involving key cards but basically I was locked out of the kitchen), and it was still pretty good.

In fact, I had it for breakfast, lunch *and* dinner that day, and had four containers left to spare.
