<p>This recipe is super forgiving and easy to customize! For example, if you want a thicker stew-like meal, just reduce the water by a quarter. You can substitute double the amount of fresh thyme for dried. The spinach can be swapped out for kale or swiss chard or left out altogether.</p>
<p>The first time I made this, I sauteed the onions and garlic in 1 tsp of sesame oil. But having done it with just water since then, I don't think the taste is hugely affected. If you're not counting calories, feel free to add some oil to make it more fragrant!</p>
<b>To make vegan:</b>
<p>Use 2 L of vegetable stock instead of water and chicken bouillon.</p>

I can't believe it's February already! Last month, I was settling into my co-op job and trying to get used to real "Adulthood."  Now things have fallen into a kind of routine, although I'm still figuring a lot of things out.Even though I had a lot of fun cooking last term, I've really discovered

When it comes to meal prep, my recipes follow three guiding principles.

1. Keeps well in the fridge (and, ideally, the freezer too)
1. Tasty (to curb my urges to eat out)
1. Low effort

I'm very happy to report that this recipe is all three!

I'm not into fresh herbs at all... every college student who tries to cook at home knows the struggle of buying a handful of cilantro or parsley for a recipe, only to have to throw away the wilted remainder a week later. There's nothing more stressful than knowing you have produce going bad in your fridge but not having a recipe to use it in. I don't want my life to be run by herbs!! That's why when I come up with recipes, I try to stick to dried spices and herbs. These babies don't go bad for a long time, plus they don't take up space in the fridge.

I also try to make my recipes versatile. This soup is super flexible on the vegetables. You can add in vegetables, like tomatoes, squash, mushrooms, etc. or substitute one for another. It's great for dumping some leftovers in!

This soup is awesome! The first day I brought this to work, I didn't even heat it up in the microwave and just ate it cold at my desk (didn't have access to a microwave back then, long story), and it was still pretty good.

In fact, I had it for breakfast, lunch *and* dinner that day, and had four containers left to spare.
