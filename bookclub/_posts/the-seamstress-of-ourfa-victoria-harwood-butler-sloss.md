At a certain time in our lives we draw a pattern and then repeat it all our lives – a little to the left, a little to the right, but always falling, eventually, into that pattern.

“My dreams were filled with sunlit shafts of water,” she told him, “and now I’d like to eat meat grilled on the bone with lemon and salt.”

On her solitary treks she most often found herself in the alleyways, watching her face distort in the beaten copper cooking pots. Nothing could compare to this colour – not silver, not gold. Love for Ferida was food. Perfume, not frankincense, but the pungent aroma from one of the huge mounds of spices piled at her feet. Touch, a hand deep in a sack of red lentils, a twig of a cinnamon curled around itself. Up on this ridge, in this silence, it is hard to imagine the noise and smell of the city below. The orospou women giggling around café doors, the street kids picking through choked gutters. The delicious aroma of skewered meat spitting over charcoal.

Food fills every page of this book. The night Seyda dies, she visits Ferida in a dream where she teaches her daughter how to stuff onions. “This is how to stuff an onion,” she’d said, pushing Ferida aside, “First you flake the golden skin off and then, with a sharp knife, make a slit in the top. Boil a pan of water, drop the onion in and let it cook for one minute. When it has cooled, take a linen cloth, wrap it around the onion and hold it firmly in one hand. Squeeze very gently and the next thing you know, the onion will pop out and you will be left with an empty shell in your hand. Then you can stuff it.”
