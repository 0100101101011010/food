Billie's character is oblivious to the point of incredulity. What is supposed to be a character flaw that endears her to readers makes me want to get so mad at her.

Throughout the novel, Billie heaps lavish praise on her late sister, which is supposed to demonstrate just how low her self-esteem is... I guess? She considers Jeannie superior to herself in every way, while the other characters fall over themselves trying to convince her otherwise. And the final reveal that Billie's "perfect" sister Jeannie is involved in drugs is the ridiculous straw that broke the camel's back.
