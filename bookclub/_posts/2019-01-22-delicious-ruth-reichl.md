excerpt: "Ruth Reichl's novel, Delicious, about a girl finding herself and falling in love in New York City, while entangling a mystery surrounding famous cook James Beard, has the distinction of being the first book I hated reading in 2019!"

Billie's character is oblivious to the point of incredulity. What is supposed to be a character flaw that endears her to readers makes me want to get so mad at her.

Throughout the novel, Billie heaps lavish praise on her late sister, which is supposed to demonstrate just how low her self-esteem is... I guess? She considers Jeannie superior to herself in every way, while other characters fall over themselves trying to convince her otherwise. She steadfastly ignores everyone's efforts to point out her talents and gifts, continuing to efface herself in comparison to her amazing perfect superstar sister.

>! The final reveal that Jeannie was involved in drugs before in drugs before her death? WOW, who would've guessed that the perfect sister isn't perfect at all! What a tasteful idea to conveniently make the deceased sibling a terrible person to let every one of us readers know what a wholesome, lovely girl Billie is.
