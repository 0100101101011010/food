I found this recipe in [Bread making and bread baking](https://archive.org/details/breadmakingbread00brot/page/26) by Minnie E. Brothers, a cookbook published in 1915!



Although she provided the ingredients, below, there were no accompanying instructions. It looks like it could be a predecessor to modern boxed yellow cake mix.

* 2 cups sugar
* 2.5 cups flour
* 1 cup milk
* 1 cup butter
* 1 tsp cream [of] tartar
* 1/2 tsp [baking] soda
* 2 tsp vanilla [extract]
* yolks of 11 eggs

I found a [recipe by Alton Brown](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/gold-cake-recipe-1913120) that seems very similar, so I used that for guidance on how long to cook for.
