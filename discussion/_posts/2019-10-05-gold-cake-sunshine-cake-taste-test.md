I found this recipe in [Bread making and bread baking](https://archive.org/details/breadmakingbread00brot/page/26) by Minnie E. Brothers, a cookbook published in 1915!

Although she provided the ingredients, below, there was no accompanying recipe:

* 2 cups sugar
* 2.5 cups flour
* 1 cup milk
* 1 cup butter
* 1 tsp cream [of] tartar
* 1/2 tsp [baking] soda
* 2 tsp vanilla [extract]
* yolks of 11 eggs
