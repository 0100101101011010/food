> In our culture if you want to express love, if you want to thank someone, food is the way to show these sentiments. I open my house; I share my food with you. It is more than a gift.

– Patrizia Faccioli, *The Italian Way*

## Emilia-Romagna

"On Sunday," Lucia says, "I make an effort to do—not great things—to make some *tagliatelle* by hand and make the *ragu* with some mushrooms ... I prepare something more, or some *pasta al forno*, or some tortelloni." They may have some ice cream, "mostly for the kids." But if there are guests she prepares a cake, or at least a pie. There is an orange cake they prefer, and the *certosino* (an Italian cake named after a Carthusian monk) is made by hand.

A study done ... in 1872 "found that in 488 communi (towns) in all regions of Italy, the majority of Italians consumed polenta, rice, pasta, or chestnuts. For the poor, wehat bread was as rare as meat."

The two regions of Emilia-Romagna have very different cuisines: the seacoast (Romagna) features soups, lighter fare, and fish. It is hard to believe, but one seldom finds the stuffed pastas and lasagnas of Bologna in seacost trattorie fifty miles to the east. ... The food of Romagna is more experimental; the recipes of Emilia (Bologna-Parma-Modena) are rigid, and the food is rich (Bologna *la grassa, la rossa, la dotta*—the fat, the red, the learned). The famous foods of Bologna include lasagna, stuffed pastas, in particular tortellini and ravioli; sausages (most famously mortadella); pasta made fresh with eggs; *ragu* made with pork; ice cream, milk, and butter from local cows. To this add northern vegetables (squash and pumpkin as ravioli stuffing), the vinegar from Modena, and, in varied forms, *prosciutto* and *parmigiano.*

Perhaps the most famous exports of this region are balsamic vinegar (from Modena), parmigiano reggiano (from Reggio nell' Emilia), prosciutto (Parma), and lasagna (Bologna).

> I must not forget to mention that in Bologna they make the best sausages that man has ever tasted. They are eaten either cured or cooked and are always appetizing. Bless the one who invented this sausage; I kiss and worship his virtuous hands.

– Ortensio Lando, *Commentario delle piu notabili e mostrusose cose d'Italia e d'altri luoghi*

### Desserts

Castagnaccio (a chestnut flour cake) and frittelle (similar to fried doughnut holes, these originate from Venice but are eaten in Bologna as well)

Torta mantovana (from the city of Mantova, or Mantua)
Pannettone (a dish invented by Ludovico Sforza, a duke of Milan, and now eaten as a Christmas tradition)
Torrone

The capital of Emilia-Romagna is Bologna, known for Europe's oldest university and its world-renowned lasagna.

Emilia-Romagna is considered one of the richest regions of Italy with regards to its gastronomic and wine-making tradition. The region is known for its egg and filled pasta made with soft wheat flour. Bologna is notable for pasta dishes like tortellini, lasagne, gramigna and tagliatelle which are found also in many other parts of the region in different declinations. The Romagna subregion is known as well for pasta dishes like garganelli, strozzapreti, sfoglia lorda and tortelli alla lastra. In the Emilia subregion, except Piacenza which is heavily influenced by the cuisines of Lombardy, rice is eaten to a lesser extent. Polenta, a maize-based dish, is common both in Emilia and Romagna. The celebrated balsamic vinegar is made only in the Emilian cities of Modena and Reggio Emilia, following legally binding traditional procedures.[24] Parmigiano Reggiano (Parmesan Cheese) is produced in Reggio Emilia, Parma, Modena and Bologna and is much used in cooking, while Grana Padano variety is produced in the rest of the region.

Although the Adriatic coast is a major fishing area (well known for its eels and clams), the region is more famous for its meat products, especially pork-based, that include: Parma's prosciutto, culatello and Felino salami, Piacenza's pancetta, coppa and salami, Bologna's mortadella and salame rosa, Modena's zampone, cotechino and cappello del prete and Ferrara's salama da sugo. Reggio Emilia is famous for its fresh egg-made pasta cappelletti (similar to Bologna's tortellini but differing in size), the typical erbazzone a spinach and Parmigiano Reggiano salted cake and its Gnocco Fritto some kind of mixed flour stripes fried in boiling oil, enjoyed in combination with ham or salami. Crescentina best known as tigella is the typical thin round bread that originates in the Apennines around Modena and it is usually filled in with the typical cunza (a spread made from pork lard and flavoured with garlic and rosemary) or with cold cuts, cheese and salty dressings or sweet spreads. Piacenza and Ferrara are also known for some dishes prepared with horse and donkey meat. In Romagna, near Adriatic coast, is famous a kind of round bread called "piadina". Regional desserts include zuppa inglese (custard-based dessert made with sponge cake and Alchermes liqueur) and panpepato (Christmas cake made with pepper, chocolate, spices, and almonds). An exhaustive list of the most important regional wines should include Sangiovese from Romagna, Lambrusco from Reggio Emilia or Modena, Cagnina di Romagna, Gutturnio and Trebbiano from Piacenza.
